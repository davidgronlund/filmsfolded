[{"movie":"Audition","heading":"Simple Folding of a Love Story","date":"12 July 2002","content":"Spoilers herein.People forget that `Casablanca' was a B-movie, made quickly and cheaply. Its success depended on its unimportance -- several modern trends were being followed by the various artists involved and they had the freedom to go a little further than they could on important films. As with that, so with this. As with Casablanca, no idea here is original. The Japanese have long been lonely, have long obsessed with child molestation, and have a deep tradition of domestic torture and all this is infused in their popular art. In the film community, there is a decades-long attention to the moody camera, and the meditative pace. The notion of blended realities goes back to Rashomon in film, and is far deeper, deeper in Japanese literature.\nThis is not a matter of Lynchism. This is naturally an artifact of Japanese popular art. Which is to say that the people involved aren't as intelligent as Lynch and Egoyan and Greenaway -- they are just attentive to matters of style. But when transported to the US art house, this project gets evaluated as if the filmmaker had the aspirations of Tarkovsky. Whether you view this as a cheap self-referential Sailor Moon or a piece of western art is up to you. I am ambiguous about this. The initial experience was heady because I assumed the real audition was of the man by the girls and that all the narrative folding was a matter of battling film personalities. Seen this way, it is a simple love story, where love is movie love, but haunted by suspicious dreams as are all loves that are not movie loves.But the intent of the filmmaker is also important to me, because the experience is not with the accidental shape of the film, instead the film is a construct for a communion with the artist. In that communion, we have have a loving, lustful, exploitive, even tortured co-existence. Seeing the DVD and Miike's presence and hearing his comment (and knowing some of his other films), one can see that this is no intellect, no artist, simply a busy stylist who is obsessed with fashion and who occasionally falls among the right people and ideas. I feel the same way about Bertollucci, by the way.Incidentally, I saw this on the DVD especially manufactured for Blockbuster to an R rating. So I am certain that some of the power was scandalously erased. I certainly think that more explicit sex, both tender and exploitive, both from selfish longing and unqualified commitment would have made this deeper -- in other words, more of the style of `Last Tango in Paris' would have helped.","id":"rw0706506"},{"movie":"Æon Flux","heading":"Credible World","date":"3 April 2006","content":"Science fiction movies are an odd thing. They and \"detective\" movies depend more heavily on literary conventions than other types of films.But you know, where detective movies have swallowed the form and adapted in rich ways, science fiction hasn't settled gently into film. Its an odd, unintuitive truth, despite the flood of science fiction movies.Some of these are mere action movies in excusably bent settings to make them seem less ridiculous. The \"real\" science fiction movies seem to be of two types, and both of those are concerned first with building an alternative universe. One path is through elaborate alternative cosmologies: Matrix, Star Wars, Ring. If you get this right, if it is sufficiently powerful, all else comes along for the ride.The other path isn't appreciated as much by the kiddies, but in a way it is more pure. That's when the alternative world is first a visual presentation. If you choose this path young jediniles, its all about the eye. Plots, characters, attitude... all these only have to be acceptable and not get in the way.With that preface, i have to say I liked this movie, as trashed as it has been.Sure, the story is stupid. Name more than three science fiction movies that aren't.The action scenes are ordinary. The acting lame. That hasn't prevented hosannas for other films.But this one has terrific art direction. No, nothing radical, but what we see in just about every scene is magical. And it all hangs together to imply just exactly the world we inhabit for that hour and a half.Imagination often shows in these things. But rarely does it show as a coherent vision in all the elements of the thing. \"Sin City\" even had problems with this. I'll ask you to watch this just for the visual impact. The camera isn't great: some \"Van Helsing\" eye-adventure would have helped.I'll rate this worth watching.

She is an observer of one small corner of life and seems incidentally a filmmaker. You get different editions of her observations on the distance of young sex across which we throw ropes.So the question is which is the best and whether each one that follows adds something new, worthwhile.The best to my mind was \"A Real Young Girl\" of thirty years ago. It had an honesty that everything subsequently lacks. By this I mean you could feel the filmmaker's emotions quite apart from whatever was happening on screen.What we have here are two scenes. The first is hugely promising: a pretty girl loses her virginity while witnessed by her much younger sister. Drawn out circling of the boy. Set up in a way that we share in the discomfort as witness and some of the charm of the situation. We are seducer, voyeur, victim.Brelliat knew this well enough to build a whole different movie about the nature of this voyeurism, \"Sex is Comedy.\" You need to see the two together to get the folding.The problem with Brelliat is that she has these emotional insights and she can pose scenes. But she has no skill at all in seeing the larger shape of the narrative. She doesn't understand the long form and the structure of a story. Lacking this, we get only scenes, and here we have only two. The second one is brutal, as if the first demanded the second.The only thing to recommend this is the effect you get from watching the first scene. You quickly realize that because you are watching, you are part of the damage she sketches.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw1217964"},{"movie":"Till sista andetaget","heading":"Not What Was Intended (`the French are Stupid Too`)","date":"22 February 2003","content":"Spoilers herein.This highly influential film is regarded because the director was a writer with interesting ideas and he could self-promote. As a result, a few theorists and all their legions of followers have designated this an `important film' and specifically for the reasons that Godard thought it was: reality vs documentary (portrait vs person) with a few filigrees of resulting unusual cinematography, editing and performance. It is amazing that these rather slight ideas had such power and influence forty years ago. Perhaps the slightness is an illusion because the ideas had such power they transformed our entire background.Here's another reading, one which presumes a complement to what Godard THOUGHT was the point: you can either be a thinker or an artist. If you are a thinker making a film, the film can only be as deep as your thoughts, which usually aren't. But if you are an artist, you tap into a knowing intuition, a state of communicative grace from something deeper than any maker or consumer of the artifact. So lets suppose Godard wasn't just a strong willed writer making statements like Ayn Rand writes. Lets say that this is a collection of forces that Godard responded to unknowingly and just dive into those forces. The French are obsessed with being important (or appearing to be so), especially in the arts and most especially in film. So when the overwhelming wave of (vulgar-by-definition) American influence so transforms the media away from your control, you need to strike back with matters of style. `New Wave' is to film as Perrier is to water - there's a real style here, but it is of a relatively synthetic nature.Michel Is French, trying to live as an American film star: this fact is pounded in a manner so bluntly it defaces the rest of the art. Patricia is an American trying to be French, working at several levels, sexual and intellectual. The French authorities (here conflated with the film intelligentsia) are feverously searching for Michel to eliminate creeping Americanism. Eventually, they succeed, aided by Particia. At the end Michel makes his film (the faces) and in a supreme irony, uses an American film posture to demean the `American' film experience. The American is flummoxed, in a double tragedy.My own belief is that in the grand scheme of things, this is a relatively trivial project. Godard WOULD go on to do some much more interesting, challenging and worthwhile work. I recommend `King Lear.' See that instead, unless you are a student in which case, Godard's writing will force you to see this.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.","id":"rw0069937"},{"movie":"Vad har jag gjort för att förtjäna detta?","heading":"Narrative Eye","date":"30 July 2006","content":"I loved this. It isn't so great compared to later projects where he knows how to use knives instead of chalk. And he decides to understand women, instead of understanding their luggage.But this is better in a way because you can see the man, what a friend calls the exposed plumbing of what later would become a polished structure.Stories in Almodovar's soul, that wonderful soul, appear first as images that only after they crack their shells into the fluttering wind of sight do they loose into their narrative trajectory. Sight first, then narrative. But because the narrative comes directly from the cinematic, it flows with an unusual naturalness. It drives into complexities, even emotion depths. It becomes surreal in places, but it all seems natural because it flows from the image within.And that gives us another advantage. Nearly all films about love and women begin all their major strokes from the written or spoken word and the situations that grow out of them. That means in film that we are stuck with a limited vocabulary and set of patterns that not only dull with repetition, but aren't cinematic at root.Even in this early film, you can see that because these eyesweets were never touched by pen, they are all fresh without leaving what we accept as true.

And as with all his films, it misses being interesting or charming. That is, unless you do a little work to punch it up. My own method is to fabulate around the Spanish tradition within which he certainly belongs. (I really liked the Spanish reflexiveness in `Lucía y el sexo.')The raw material for the reflection is deliberately put there: it is a film about a film, where the merging of the two isn't obvious.Marina is a strawberry blond porno actress with a sister-manager, Lola, and a drug problem. She is lovers with Pepe who lives in a grandly furnished apartment, adjacent to the smaller place he provides for her.  Lola and Pepe are pimps of a sort for show business and arrange for her to play in a film. It will be the last film of Máximo. All three are involved in the film: Máximo directs, Lola is the writer, Pepe is the art director, you the audience are the cinematographer. All are infatuated with her.\nWhat we see is the movie that results from the various tugs from each of these. It starts out (well into the film after the madman is invented) with the `reality' prefilming the final sequence. Máximo is being interviewed and the reporter sees an actor, Osvaldo, from real life a fat guy. We later see him in the `movie' as a really well built guy. Marina is directed to act like the reporter when she sees her man. This is the first obvious indication that the film and the film within are to be merged.`Midnight Phantom' is the movie being made, putting one's heart and genitals on the line. Marina and the phantom tussle with Marina left hanging. Then the real merger of film realities get shuffled. The mental patient, her drug problems (disguised as `toothache'), her unfulfilled sexual desires, and the needs of her film `managers' result in her being tied up/down, which rescues her from her rut.Its driven home by the mental patient's talent as an artist who `draws' the film -- a drawing of his comes to life to start the movie.There is a particularly nice shot: after Rocky gets out of the nuthouse/sexual prison, he is on the sidewalk in a long shot that flattens space like one of his animated drawings. A pretty redhead girl skating back and forth is rather poetic.The self-reference is nearly out of reach as the film masquerades as a sexual comedy.

The story is quite different. The Matrix has real people living in a synthetic world; simple enough. `13th Floor' is much more sophisticated: real and artificial people living in many parallel synthetic worlds -- there is not just ambiguity about environment, but over beingness.eXistenZ is more sophisticated yet in this dimension: synthetic worlds are not parallel but nested. Some real world exists which creates a synthetic world which in turn creates another synthetic world and so on. More: in this film, conspiracies blend levels, reversing and folding roles. This is the stuff of Phil Dick, not the Matrix, or The One, or any of that other juvenile stuff.But there is a more fundamental difference: Films like the matrix start with a story concept, then work to tell the story by whatever visual vocabulary is current. Cronenberg starts with a specific strong vision and hangs a story on it. Clearly, his vision here is for artificially living sexual paraphernalia. These have highly erotic exteriors but disgusting, reptilian interiors. The whole film is built around this notion: prurient fiction, repellent pudenda.And the whole thing self-referentially encompasses the audience with the final level because the film clearly shows itself to be a creation in the same mold as Allegra's. I love this stuff, if only as an intellectual construction.But what puzzles me is Cronenberg's meekness. He knows he's a cult filmmaker, so why pander to a bunch of kids who will go to `The One' instead? Jennifer has the guts to do whatever is required. Her presence here shows edge by reference, because we know that she would risk all if asked. But she's not asked. I predict that in a decade or so, as a reaction to special effects fatigue, someone with more courage will remake this with an X rating and more of an obvious Marienbad feel.

Czech films just aren't very good. It isn't that Czechs aren't clever or intelligent. And they do have a rich stage culture. But some cultures map cinematically and some don't. And those that do, map in different ways. Fascinating. However, this film has a very clever story. And it is more clever than it seems, because of the way we are spoonfed the answers. A man goes back in time to create a double, changing events. Its a bit elaborate, involving Hitler and latter-day Nazis, but that's beside the point.The complexity is really about the doubles and working out the intercessions. Loves and affairs. Some clever humor here, similar to the Shakespearian bits about disguises.It all ends well, and there is no puzzle, unlike, say \"Primer.\" But wait! Actually there is. There's a hint that the fact that our hero has a twin is a result of the doubling, and that the events will repeat over and over again later.I searched this odd film out in my quest for the quintessential Czech movie.

This is his best in my estimation. His entire career can be seen as experiments leading to his feature-length `Alice,' punctuated by unsophisticated, uninteresting social commentary. `Alice' is fatally flawed, however, because he grossly misunderstands the richness of the story.But this project is not so limited. The little known origin of Carroll's poem is his father's membership in a society to `restore' the English language to its Saxon origins by expelling the French influence. Along the way, Dodgson goofed in all sorts of linguistic jokes based on non-specific sounds. It is the first poem whose images aren't bound to the intent of the poet.Svankmejer surfs this territory by making his own touchstones that have no meaning, but which tap subtle controversies and give us subtle traction on which we can build our own film.

In fact, I liked it. It has more jokes, and better jokes than any of the parody movies I've seen in years. Here's the setup. W Bush has stolen a fourth term and declared war on a dozen countries, including France. So many soldiers are getting killed that labs have invented a virus that reanimates them so that they can keep on fighting, and harder. This virus gets into a stripper establishment with the result that the strippers once infected get \"better,\" or at least more popular with the goofs.Sounds like it could be a mess, and it is. I think of it as some sort of triangulation among Tarantino's fake sleaze \"Death Proof,\" but more genuine, \"10,000 Corpses\" but with something other than snarls and \"Shaun of the Dead\" but with more clever jokes.The interesting thing is that there are breasts here. But they are part of the irony, the big joke. They are deliberately depicted to be as artificially defective as the zombie countenance. In fact, the folding here is that we have an on-screen audience of male louts who reward the zombie strippers above the \"regular\" girls, so they willingly become zombies to be sexier.The jokes range from cinematic jokes to comments on social issues, and they are at a higher level than usual.One of the strippers is a former Playmate and that's supposed to be some sort of draw.

Its a sort of quantum physics of narrative. Not the uncertainty side, but the fact that there are different states; you can be at one state or another or another but never in between. Humans think this way, perhaps because you cannot have half a person, half a mind.Anyway, there are several discrete stations that we accept in relation to film stories, several discrete distances between what we are allowed to see and what our avatar(s) see in the story. At one end is the mystery where our relationship is more with the writer or some god than the emotions in the story.And then at the other end is stuff like this, the purest form of which is the procedural. In this case, there is a mystery, a story to discover. We have on-screen detectives and within certain narrow limits, we discover what the detectives do. We may see things a little before, but we never see more or know more than they. Procedurals only appeared well after the detective meme settled into our narrative vocabulary. So it is a sort of second generational shift in the mechanics of discovery.And who is at the center? Robert Downey Jr, one our most talented folders  and by that I mean someone who plays a role, but also plays a metarole of an actor playing a part. Here his character tries to horn in on the narration and fails, becoming a substance abuser. How meta is that?I like Fincher. I like it when he is bolder, but all these guys like to do a project from time to time where the art is in the precision of the narrative placement. And he does amazingly well. It would have had to have been a procedural.There's a shot of the murdercab where the precision is noted as it follows the cab to the place. We are precisely over, precisely. The cab stays precisely in the center of the frame. Precisely. We are locked into what it moving, with no allowance for godly insight from other contexts.

But this has changed my impression that he is incapable of making wise, effective choices.Now I must see the other two in this \"series.\" Here's what you'll experience. The filmmaker is Iranian in situation, but French in intellect. That means his movies will be about movies, or will cast life as a movie with discrete references to films.In this case we have a film being made. To elaborate on the distance between us and the film the first scene is a man introducing himself as the actor who plays the director.The film within is cast and begins shooting. We see take after take, seemingly repeated endlessly. Each time, something goes wrong because reality intrudes. Slowly the film becomes about that reality instead of the film: the boy and girl playing a young married couple are from the nearby village and he has been courting her and has been turned down by her grandmother. (Her parents are dead.)He has seen her only a few times, but is in love with her. He thinks he saw an expression once in her that reciprocates. Now in between those interminable takes he begs her to express her love. These take the form most purely of her reading, deliberately ignoring him, and he (an illiterate) telling to turn the page if you love me.She demurs through the whole film until the end which has a very long slow scene. Very long, wordless. And she gives an answer that we impute so indirectly is it a far  literally far  observation. One amazing thing that occurs is our wonder that the filmmaker expects us to tolerate what he is doing. The other is that we do. So I would recommend this. But there's an issue that disturbs. This works for me because the society depicted is so alien, so unbelievable. The women here are women only in that they are allowed to have children. They are beings only in the most technical of senses. One wonders if such a place can really exist on the planet, or if it is a concoction or art to merely show the weakness of man.I say this because I have a notion of symmetry in folding. I think successful art that represents itself has the same \"semantic distance\" on both sides. In other words, there is the same degree of abstraction between our real world and the foundation world of the film, and that is the same distance to the film (or art) within. I find this so prevalent that I pose it as a law of introspection.So here we have a film that I assume was made for Iranian viewing, by viewers that would accept the world of women we see, wouldn't wonder at the third world infrastructure, would knowingly accept the dilemma of proud illiteracy. That places the world of the viewer very close to that of the movie within. Or does it?

Friends, if you are reading this and haven't yet seen the film, I have stolen the joy of discovery without knowing; but please do see this. It is precious.It is something between the best of Tarkovsky and what you might like of Kar-Wai Wong.The story is purely in service to the cinematic images, and those are in service to some very pure notions: Poetry as love, love as travel, travel as painting, painting as copying one's self and sending it out, going out as diving into water, diving as love, love as poetry.Unbelievably, each of these concepts is displayed in images of a train. You have to see it to believe it. Trains have been with film since the very beginning, and have been handled by masters. But I have never seen it so thoroughly explored, extended and exhausted as here.The narrative is folded and shifting. It could be a poem, a porcelain painting, a story from each of the four main characters that invents the others. It is quite confusing the first time around.The main thread is in the real world: a porcelain artist falls for a poet in another city. He writes poems for and about her, including her journeys on the train to see him. He gets sent to Tibet. She follows and on the way back is killed in an accident. Later, another woman (played by the same actress) meets the now famous poet and they fall in love. Or do they? This second woman travels on the same train.All of this is chopped and shifted around in presentation, and you have no idea who is telling or seeing what, including several episodes where the first girl also falls for a veterinarian she meets on the train. He may be an imaginary figure. Both the girl and the poet love two people but their bond, at least according to the poems, is much stronger.That's all the story you need to know to not be unsettled and to just go with the flow.What reminds me of Tarkovsky is the way the camera invokes parallel realities as if it glances into the mind as easily as outside a window. The camera is restless and goes to odd places, but once there temporarily becomes meditative. The simplest scenes become blossoms.If you ever loved someone distant, you'll recognize the magic of yearning driving a mythologizing of reality.You have probably seen the actress who plays the two women, Li Gong.

Need to preserve the deduction, reclusiveness, probably the drugtaking, bachelorhood and of course establish a Watson of some type.Here we have young Kasden's solution. The engagement here is not so much with guessing the story -- all is revealed very early. Instead the game is watching a movie that likely could have been great, and superimposing your own solutions to make it better.Stiller and Pullman are good enough choices. But we see little of Zero's talent. Most of what we see is ordinary snooping. His haunted ruminations don't seem connected to the rest of him. This needed some work. Stiller's character too -- we have no idea why he is indispensable. Probably the one element of Watson that should have been kept is his daftness sometime prompting insights.But so much in this genre is defined not by characters entering a situation, but characters who are defined by a situation -- and the situation here isn't very interesting. It has some promise, with a couple false conclusions, but no red herrings. Ryan O'Neal reminds of William Shatner. Horrible. And our mastermind female never charms, never seems intelligent. Dickens just cannot project that magic illusion of manipulating the environment according to some inscrutable plan.I think this young filmmaker has some clever general notions about what works, but he seems to lack the talent or intuition to really make those notions sing.","id":"rw0478891"},{"movie":"Spegeln","heading":"Reflections Reflections Reflections","date":"3 September 2002","content":"Spoilers herein.Many films allow one immediate response; you know while watching how effective it is and at the end are geared for talking or writing about what you have just seen.Others, you need to spend time with. This -- I am guessing here -- is because the truly great so lead our imagination that we need to heal or grow after the experience and only then assess what has happened. Surely when you are in this film, you know something special is going on: there are some true transcendences of the eye; very dimensional, surprising. Just as you have established the field of vision and registered the one thing you expect to see, the camera moves in an unexpected manner to reveal either a completely extra or contradictory reality.Those moments thrill, but confuse at the same time because in lesser hands, this would be an excuse for noodling about with the 'story' in a superficially artsy-fartsy manner. Only after some time can you evaluate how effectively this might have slipped between the sheets of your minds. It is a matter of some interest to me how this happens when it does. Is it a matter of the artist knowing us better than we do ourselves and slipping into our dreams unawares? Or is a matter of creating an attractive castle that we are drawn to and inhabit?Generally, when an artist is called 'personal,' it is thought to be the latter. But in this case, I think most of what he has done is find that universal manner of overlapping and merging that underlies the visual memory of us all. What confuses is the Soviet environment: the intensely uncoordinated industrial environment and the once fine but now dilapidated urban residences. They transport us to a different place: the unfamiliar described in a familiar way.Surely this is not what he intended: he didn't make this for a comfortable American/European. And if not made just for himself it was for people who shared the same world. So at least as far as the content, we are attracted to an unfamiliar castle. But so far as the 'personal' form, I think he has found something strangely cosmic.

It is echoed in the story, of course, which gives Woody a chance to mug and romance his new girl. (She `saves' him.)Anyone who thinks this is about a man needs to have his license to watch Woody revoked.I consider this a practice session for his best film: `Sweet and Lowdown,' which deals with these same issues, in the same way but so much more subtly and powerfully. That's in part because Woody's biggest liability as a director is Woody the actor, and he substituted the best folded actor in the world. But it is also because `Sweet' didn't have the distraction of manipulating old film.Still, this is a pretty sweet idea, the idea of having a character be sufficiently powerful that he is able to actually modify existing filmed history.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw0206942"},{"movie":"Zack and Miri Make a Porno","heading":"Dumpy Mirror","date":"2 February 2009","content":"Another movie mashup.

Among the small ones is the deconstruction of the western, which was transformed forever by the chain of events started by (and depicted in?) this film. I recommend Yojimbo if only because of this importance.That chain starts with the spaghetti westerns which introduced irony into most elements of the form more obviously for us, well westerners. And it finishes (probably) with `Star Wars,' which is nothing more than a slightly shifted selfaware goof on the already outed western. That this is based on a Hammett story should be a tipoff as he did the same for the mystery genre. Kurosawa did this knowingly of course. You can see his other projects marching through other notions of film and revolutionizing them.Naturally, there are other values here: perfect framing; multiplanar visual storytelling through mime; and a camera that denotes the eye of fate. But by the time one gets to this after seeing such masterpieces as `Ran' and `Rashomon' and `Seven Samurai,' especially the first, one gets used to expecting skill from Kurosawa equalling the skill of his samurai avatar.If you know what this movie is all about, it puts `Last Man Standing' in a much more intelligent and cinematically important perspective.

We move into the world, moist, breathing, shaping moist breath to cause and shape things. We are worlds unto ourselves, feeding our lovers oysters with colored eyes engaged.From behind we are flat. Things have occurred. We are no longer agents weaving worlds but effects of a hungry system. We are no longer worlds but bits of a machine who chases us, closing in on our excretions of different types. Our sexual organs are balanced between, subject to being swallowed by fate, by mechanics alien in every way, but yearning to be the stuff of agency, making, being.Its at this fractal edge this film (and its companions by this filmmaker) places itself, determined to scintillate between being, causing, at the front and noir structure behind, flat. Only the Japanese can approach this precipice in this way because only they have this tradition of flatness in image. Kurosawa solved it by superimposing sliding planes. Ishi by sliding narratives, conflicting in direction: things happening, caused versus things that have happened seeking explanation. He also leverages the ghost story form that seems to go back a millennium. I applaud his ambition, and viscerally thrill at the cinematic investment. Its where art comes from. All art fails... that's the risk. Its just a matter of whether the artist has the confidence in how HE moves, because we can only see his flat backside. Ishi has that confidence, which you can sort into structure, and thence into life. And then if you dare into encounter.Its then that you determine whether it is deep, a love, something that changes or merely tastes. In my case, I have to report, dear reader, that I was not transformed by this. This is not a life-altering encounter as some are. But it is something, not nothing, to have a film designed to be fully entered from behind. It is not trivial to find something open. In this case, the watcher is a pretty young woman who presents that cultured coyness unique to Japan that reports (here by letters) her willingness, no, eagerness to succumb. By entering, you breath, and that's enough.If you want a report from behind: the film is a mystery story about a male bus driver who may be a serial killer and his next victim, a pretty bus conductor who has placed herself in that position to investigate. Nominally, it is a game, a labyrinth, that the two enter, enclosed, largely pre-determined but with some choices.

It deepens my experience from the great filmmakers to orchestrate the context so.Italians make a fuss over the simple pleasures. They eat like they speak, with their entire upper bodies as they caress the most direct abstractions. Their language is designed to be beautiful in itself in that easy alliterative tossing of vowels.But those simple abstractions crowd out the more sophisticated ones as one can see in (by Mediterranean standards) absurdly blunt religion, politics, even crime and sex.Each person must make a choice whether the simple pleasures are worth the cost of the deeper ones. It is a matter of design versus art.Kurosawa chose the more difficult path his entire life except for a brief interlude with the Soviets and here.Usually his films begin life as meditations on ineluctable insights, then get captured in detailed paintings. The resulting film images provide insight into the ideas, which is the thing that makes his films worth living with. `Ran' is complex and is a different film on each viewing, each one potentially lifealtering. Not so here. Sometimes film can be personal, but that is impossible when you must have many collaborators. In order to come to some common purpose; things need to START with the visual as sort of a lowest common denominator. That's why special effects film are rarely worth the viewing.Here, Kurosawa has scores of collaborators, so he needs to shape his film in the Italian way. That's why the fulcrum of the thing features our leading Italian-style filmmaker as an ersatz Van Gogh. (He incidentally misunderstands Van Gogh, by the way. Vincent was perhaps our most cerebral and literate painter. His absinthe addiction and porphyria gave us the first intelligent hallucinogenic art. But his intent was very conscious and deliberate, not the obsessive Italian locomotive of intuition depicted here.) But never mind, we get what he means.In this simple, lowest common denominator, Kurosawa falls back on solidly established tradition of Japanese ghost stories, particularly the films of (???) as a short cut. Only the first one and a half story and the last deliver what makes him special beyond the genre.Those segments are excuses for highly abstract pageants, self-referentially staged - with the watcher (nominally the filmmaker) built in. The last one is the one that sticks with you. It is amazing how often over the years I have consciously recalled that funeral procession.That last story is perfectly ironic. A 103-year old man preaches a simple life while surrounded by waterwheels that superficially appear nature-friendly. But instead of being the primitive devices he is working on, they are made of machined lumber with excessive use of bolts. It is as if we were all in a great modern machine that we have abstracted into something that comfortably feels like nature. I'm sure that is the way it was with this elaborate studio set.The mechanisms of those wheels is some combination of his generative imagination, Mother Nature and the gears of society.I can hear him saying `I'm not dead yet,` like his alter ego in `Madadayo,' but with a certain resignation of a valued life lived without the simple pleasures.

Movies were made, the commercial ones, to last a few weeks and perhaps make some money. Then, the film would be recycled, the messages lost and the material reused.Few of the creators had any notion that someone would be watching in 40 years, or even 400. Now as it happens, I was watching films when this was made, so even though I'm coming to it out of its context, I do know the Manson murders and some notion of where Japanese film and society were. But the truth is that I cannot connect with this the way the filmmaker intended; I'm just too far removed in time and culture.I can guess from the outside: the nudity would have been shocking in the time and place; the dramatic devices more effective. The depiction of society as fundamentally damaged is universal and reachable but not through the vehicles used here: the Japanese obsessions with virginal sex; the particular abstractions of Japanese comics; the Japanese tradition of suicide, essentially religious; the Japanese tradition of ritualized stage drama  the role that filmmakers played in Japanese society as challengers of culture that has no counterpart in the west.And then there's the dark side of zen, that violence heals.So how do I watch this? Do I pretend I am the intended audience? I do that for some films, and in some cases where it is a film I have seen, I recapture that prior self as well as the filmmaker's intended effect. And if I am pretending, do I go as far as pretend to be the audience the filmmaker is criticizing instead of being on the filmmaker's side?Do I watch it for historical value, looking for its place in the development of films that do affect me directly today? That's easy enough, given the importance of Kurosawa to me, based on a connection that largely transcends context. But it seems a lot of layers to go through for something that was meant so simply.The story here is of a girl who defines herself as a virgin because she bleeds when gangraped. We learn that she imagines a previous gangrape but in fact she has been serially abused by her father, making both parents suicide. There's a celebration of the sometimes warm, sometimes cold concrete on which this blood is displayed. A boy provides an on screen watcher, intended to be ourselves, folded into the story. He  and the imputed we  have tremendous problems with sex, alternately hot and cold. Violent or adverse.

After all, this is the place that gave us Maddin, Cronenberg, Hartley and Egoyan.Enough of it worked to hold me, and it was clear that the writing was intended to take advantage of the overlap between scenes. But two of them were problematic. One was designed to play with the folded notion that we as ready voyeurs would negatively judge an on-screen voyeur. This really could have anchored the thing but the stance did not merge well with the others and was apparently written by someone else.A second situation involved an unexpected role reversal, a sort of sexual con within the expected con.

Sex.It is an important project, taking the seat of the characters and extending it into a space around them. The challenge for the actors is to project out into a haze that surrounds them. It only works because the space is confined, incidentally in a boat. Orson Welles conceived the idea but his project was unfinished. Polanski finished it.Polanski's project was told from the perspective of the couple. Presumably the man is a lawyer with his out-of-law wife (his mistress). It is all about laws of various kinds.Now imagine a project with the identical approach but told from the point of the drifter. What is his story? What is his haze?Watch the two together if you dare. This time around we have a more ostentatious art: beautiful staging, terrific lighting, hazy score. Absolutely controlled and contained acting. And yet at the same time we have the haze extending to grit, humanity, sweat, rutting.This time around that reality gives us more explicit and human sex.

In fact Kyser comes on at the end and assures the audience that Lorre, Karloff and Lugosi aren't really murders. Within that are several performances of the band, performances I assume are similar to what they did in non-movie-land. Two performances. Added to that in a clever way is a third. For this you need some background.From about 1880 to 1910, many North Americans were spiritualists. Yes, about as many as today call themselves evangelists, the movement that displaced spiritualism. The rapidity of the change is breathtaking in a sociological context and interesting in itself. By the thirties, the \"next\" generation was making serious fun of spiritualism, usually in terms of uncovering a fake séance.I've found several earlier fake séance movies, but they are all in the context of detective movies. That's another story all together. Superficially, they look like the fakery in this movie: a secret room, microphones, special effects, gullible participants holding hands.

You can enter a film for various reasons, and one type is there to provide you with a template of what you would like to be like. You go to these films not so much for an experience, but an anti-experience; you want to identify in a way that reinforces your identity.If the movie is too ambitious, or too much work to watch, you cannot feel superior enough to adopt it as the brand that you belong to. Naturally, kids are one target for this sort of thing, but they are not alone: check out nearly all sports films, most `date' movies, and of course traditional porn.These movies always have `good parts,' where you get the brand, and deliberately bad filler that you can guffaw over and generally feel superior about. Its all about branding and brand acceptance.In this case, whether you like this is a matter of whether you by the brand, because this dance style is as authentic as urban sports attire.But you already knew that.I'll go to ANY dance movie. That's because since `Red Shoes' the dancing eye of the camera has been part of the engagement with the dancers. The very best such films use a camera that is a coherent part of the dance. `Dogtown' did this, if you'll allow me to say that skating is urban dance.So I was eager to see how this fellow waterbug handled it - he is supposed to be `genuine' himself. Urban music is overtly unsophisticated, regular in 4/4 rhythm and mundane in harmonics. Its appeal - like the porn brand - is the rest, where energy and local in** (very local to the beat, what musicians call rubato) give us appeal.The camera does two things: switch between high and low (knee level), and do so more or less to the beat. Two cameras are used on all the dances except the last where four are present. I was pretty disappointed because there really is an art to hiphop and there are cinematic tools Stokes could have used: rhythm in the camera, time shifts (like the back and forth or turntable scratching), emphasis on body parts other than faces and knees. None of this. So it stabs the brand in the back.

Its a doozy and also a metaphor of why this fails so dramatically.First the joke: Among the many talents of Zohan is his mastery of hackysack. This is the game of tossing a small beanbag around without using your hands. This sport, the only one mentioned, stands in as the competitive monster in the Middle East. It provides a plot point: a Jewish/Arab sack-off that entices a whole section of town away so the real bad guy can do his worst.So from time to time through the movie you see Zohan practice. The joke is that one of those practices with his two buddies involves keeping a cat aloft. Now the skill in pulling off something like this should not be under-appreciated. Its all in the sounds the cat makes, sounds which convey annoyance and not danger. (The cat is shown immediately after as merely miffed.) I am sure those sounds were created by a comedian and refined many times. It really is a bit of comic genius, original and funny, unlike anything else in the film.You see. The Adam Sandler films that work for me are the ones that create an alternative world, whose existence and difference with (what we think of as) the real world are funny. The world is funny. Then just existence is a joke that you can embellish, but only slightly lest you break the spell. This is hard to do. It takes work on all fronts and a single mind must reign. Consistency is everything.Then you have the more common type of comedy. In this model, you get as many jokewriters involved as you can. Its all about gags. Funny thing about humor (Heh.): people don't remember the jokes that don't work, and if you hit a quota they will only remember that \"it was funny.\" I believe that quota has been constant since Laurel was hit by Hardy. So its a volume business.But these two models fight each other because each gag, each writer cares nothing about the containing world. Its just every gag for itself, chaos. Its the same sort of near-term elbow-pushing politics that this movie tries to disarm and in the process amplify.Sandler usually can be counted on to anchor a comic world, to be the focus of the comic cosmos.

And sometimes when it is just a play, it is a just a forum for the playwright's reaching. Fair enough I suppose.You'll find a lot of those in the 30's, where America was trying to find itself and was toying with socialist ideas that today seem radical. At the same time, movies were trying on several ideas in a quest to discover what they were.Both of these exploratory periods are largely forgotten today and the options they offered aren't grieved as they should have been.This play was a sentimental screed on the terrors of capitalism, and how it necessarily destroys the soul of everyone who participates. The bad guy drives competitors to death, aspires to be the world's largest arms provider, a monopoly in fact. Bankers = bad. Dropouts - good.There's an inserted bit where our hero (Barrymore) refuses to pay taxes on the grounds that they do nothing useful. And another (from the play) where inept cops arrest the crowd as suspected Soviet revolutionaries. They are tossed in a cell with folks obviously there because of financial injustices.Its entertaining enough, and if you thought \"Wonderful Life\" was a great film, you'll like this too. You'll probably like \"V for Vendetta\" also, as it is a similar simpleminded polemic wrapped in a minimum of cinematic sugar. Same core, different sugar.And it is the sugar, after all that makes this work.In the similar, later one for Stewart, \"Pot O Gold,\" the characters weren't comical. They did comical things, but none of them were ridiculous, even the greedy capitalist who, like in this, needs to buy a house and is thwarted by happy campers.This script is different (Pulitzer-winning, incidentally). Silly characters populate the thing: A girl who imagines herself a ballerina and can't stop dancing; her dope husband who still thinks he is on the College football team; a man obsessed with fireworks; another with mechanical toys and so on.

First, the sad news, at least for the Chinese, that the Japanese have finally won. This is a Japanese film in all important respects: the theming by lush color, the rather modern notion of benevolent conquest (genuinely originating in the Persians but only used since as justification for selfish empire, specifically in this case Japanese conquest - and adopted by the Chinese only since the war) and of course the wholesale swallowing of Kurosawa.Kurosawa is here obviously in the story: it is half 'Rashomon' and half 'Ran.' But more important is Kurosawa's theory of film as a device to capture space. As with Parisian impressionist painters, the thing painted is not the point. It provides an origin only; the painting is about all the magical things that happen in the space between the subject and the viewers eye. The paintings, and Kurosawa's films are about that space.Kurosawa invented the technique of shooting from very far away with a telephoto so as to flatten space, and at the same time creating (usually three) layers of space. Often, he would engage the space directly.This masterful film is obsessive about the point and may be the most lush swim in dimensional space you are likely to find with the technology we have. Every shot is oriented around not the action, but the space that contains the action. Falling water, dust, lots of blown fabric and hair, feathers, arrows, even book tablets and those leaves! With lots of bamboo screens, all these are used to show the space, plus the usual fantastic mountains, clouds and forests - even at the end the Great Wall and of course the moving waves of soldiers and courtiers.Many of the architectural shots are lifted from Welles' \"Othello.\"The matter is not lost in the copious allusions to mental space: the game of Go, music, calligraphy, politics, and love. All these are defined, exercised and conflated with one another in terms of space and the intrigue of space with a little more effort in the latter items on the list. Then, waving lamps are used to make 'murderous intent' spatial.Unlike 'Crouching Tiger' which this resembles not at all, the camera is static, not dancing. Where Lee emphasized the ballet of the fight by engaging his camera, Zhang stands back in the space. Where Lee conceives fights not among the participants but their masters, Zhang shows us not the fights, but the battles among the true worlds of the fights - the worlds of different colors.What we see could be the imaged Go game, or the imaged fight within it, or the imaged story Nameless tells, or the one the King tells and on and on with nestings of imaginations. Every nation creates their own movie to explain themselves. We in the US seem to like more militarist stuff. Except for the thuggish motive (my war for my kind of peace), we would do well to have stories about stories like this one through four layers until they reflect back on the origin. Complex story space in rich real space.If you are going to see this, you really must see 'In the Mood for Love,' which features Broken Sword and Flying Snow in something of the same relationship they have here.

That way, I can report to you on various sub-hobbies -- like the one concerned with style and camera choreography. That's why I sought out this film at any rate: there's a cinematic sub-art associated with the imposition of style on a ballet of gunfights. John Woo is a major figure in this little corner of cinema.My own preference is for less overt choreography, more choreographed cameramovements, more style in the image and less strutting in the character. That's why I prefer Kar-wai Wong. But there were parts of \"face/off\" and \"MI2\" whose excess along these lines thrilled me, despite the strutting men.So now we come to what many believe is the earliest successful attempt at Wooist style. Looking at the first films of a master is often pretty rewarding. After all, nearly every film of this type is a bad film, painful in places. So watching one a little less good is no sacrifice: we watch these for moments. And in earlier films those moments are often fresher, more exciting.And that's the case here. There are some really horrid sequences, like the tussle resulting in the father's death. And there's the junky story -- oh and bad acting, even by Hong Kong standards. But there are a couple sequences that are very successful: both involving Yun-fat Chow of course: toward the beginning he takes revenge: and later he steals a computer tape.

The story and craft are all fine, just not memorable. But the food was rich, and that alone makes this an important film.Film is a solvent art. Successful film leverages senses and emotions outside of itself, moreso than other arts. Only dance and architecture are similar in the directness and externalness. Violence, sex, celebrity, betrayal are the usual suspects. Food has been done before, but it appears to be difficult to evoke the sense of taste as richly through vision as we need.Lee has the advantage of Chinese cuisine, the preparation of which is strange and intriguing to Americans at least. He captures us by the mystery of what is going on by showing a lengthy preparation session before the first \"story\" scene, so we are in suspense about context.\nBut Lee also has real art in what and how he has placed the images. He understands that it doesn't work to focus on the food itself. He gives us rich sounds -- gosh, what sound editing skills! He gives us movement as edibles slide from one implement to another. He gives us aromatic visions as things sizzle and smoke. He gives us ceremony in the presentation, but all BEFORE the table, made special meditations because once things get near the table, they are treated casually.Here is an echo of the hundredtwenty year old debate in the academy concerning easel painting. Portraits (character studies) are acceptable, human art. Landscapes are \"real\" art (in film, think of \"Lawrence,\" \"Out of Africa\"... Ford westerns... maybe 1/4 of all films). But, so the academics held, \"domestic still lifes\" cannot be real art. At least we know this form is difficult and therefore rare in painting. More difficult and rare in film.

Now I regret not having prepared better.Filmmaking for me is calligraphy on water.A filmmaker's art can be in the shape of what is written. Nolan, for example does well with this. It can be in how it is written. Kurosawa and Wells are good examples.Or it can be in the nature of the *brush,* the instrument of capture itself. Kae Wai Wong is the only living filmmaker that works in all three simultaneously. So far as the story, I was lost much of the time. This clearly was made for a Chinese audience who would know the history and characters — and who would appreciate important regional differences. The unrolling was slightly non-linear but that was not a hindrance. Nevertheless, the three stories had power: a meditation on soulmates, a tragedy of lost/stolen tradition, an implicit history of cinematic fight styles. These are indeed treated as if they are fluid flows, only partly captured and disturbed by the looking. Some of the shifts from realistic to formalized (not unlike Herzog) underscore this.Among the various threads on screen, the love story was what engaged me. Power in its restraint. A sort of noble but incomplete joy in the tragedy. Waiting to say little. Alone. The nature of the tragedy has so many ambiguous overtones it bleeds into an open life, which I presume to be a requisite for any of his films.Among the threads behind the camera, I found the strokes here to be novel. This is film about traditions being merged to create power, a power incidentally that spawned a choreographic tradition in cinema. It seems as if the partnership with the new cinematographer (after the rich relationship with Chris Doyle), is based on moving from one *style* to another.We have a variety of cinematic perspectives, many of which are beautiful. But the point seems to be the transitions one to another, the movement from one world-view to another. Lyrical vision, always expanded vision. Slow eye jazz. Experimental rhythms. Typical to this filmmaker is a reference to this: the ultimate fight scene is photographed with four perspectives, each with a unique style. *Behind* is a train that starts and by the end of the fight (and causing the end) it is racing. The effect is amazing. I am used to the patterns he used with Doyle, whose choppiness clipped Kar Wai's meditations. Doyle's drifting complemented Kar Wai's fixed meditations. Now, it seems he has a new worthy collaborator, a partner in exploring new mixes, new expressions. I don't know this fellow well, but of course have seen his work.

These are only accidentally associated with noir in my mind; the real core of noir is the creation of a world that has features we as viewers expect and to some extent control. This filmmaker understands this, so has used noir for his narrative experiment.The experiment revolves around a science fiction device: a notebook with some secrets of Quantum Interaction. The backstory has experiments that use repetitive number patterns to allow a researcher to start to bend time. Two lovers have faded in their love. She is a detective put on a case that leads them to this notebook. He engages in the experiment to recapture their love at the cost of his soul. The story is told from her POV, which involves non-linearity in three respects: what we see and understand, what she sees and understands, what is understandable (in the sense of the physics changing). This last is to the heart of noir, where the act of seeing changes the cosmos.Her cat is named Schrödinger. She has a doppelganger (her sexy female anima), played by a woman who dominates: she is a muse/teacher. She literally is the producer of the film, and she provides some competent moody songs. All of the actors are people we should know from various, mostly bad TeeVee, science fiction. It is all rather brilliant in the way it is conceived and worth seeing because of the ambition.The problems are many though. The actual narrative, those threads you weave out of the fragments you are given? It just is poorly done. This needs more power in the actors, the lines and the cinema. It references urges that can bend the world. Polanski does this and delivers. \"Ninth Gate.\" There is no there here. You may not notice this because it is easy enough to supply that romantic urge: we all have it and have nurtured it in our movie experiences. We carry it into this project and can plug in, indirectly increasing the narrative effect.So that is not a lethal problem. The other problem may not bother you, but it worries me greatly.This experiment relies on some detailed explanations of the \"science\" involved. As with many popular-level notions, we have selections from the most accessible and attractive features of Jungian cosmology mixed in with common misconceptions of quantum physics. It plays the same role in this story that mentioning a recent meteorite has in zombie movies. You nod, agree that the explanation is plausible and move on to consume the narrative.The problem is both Jung and QI have possibilities that are much more powerful than those appropriated here. You can't start fire with water just because on screen it looks like gasoline.

All other films carry the burden of nationality, and it is a heavy burden indeed. That's because films define society and `national' films attract undue expectations to define what it means to be French, or whatever. It is burden enough when the country has a healthy economy, a long history with film, and political stability. But when the country lacks any of these, each marginally competent film gets blown up to mythic proportions.So it was within a whirlwind of expectations that I viewed this as a non-Mexican North American. My own experience with Spanish-speaking literature and film is relatively slight, but from `Quixote,' through Borges, hispanics have led us all in intelligent self-reference. In the last few decades, this has merged with post-modern fabulism or `magical reality' to produce some similarly great art.But there is a backlash from the street, which promotes the frank, impulsive sexuality of hispanics. And so we have Spanish films that are about sensual caprice. And people flock to them for self-definition. I recently saw a most amazing film: `Lucía y el sexo,' which to my mind was a superb blend of the two: Spanish self-aware abstraction folded into a selfserving passion for sex as life. Both literary and cinematic.Now along comes this film, that doesn't make any such synthesis. It in fact sticks entirely to the `passion-for-life' side, goobered up with some political commentary and wrapped in a traditional `dying girl' wrapper. That this is deliberate can be seen in the girl leaving her writer husband, whose friends talk about intellectual things she doesn't think important. Its pleasant enough, especially the dialog, and I didn't mind watching it. But knowing that millions of Mexicans adjust their sense of self using this template is somewhat tragic.So let's emphasize what element remains of interest: the narrative structure. There are three narrative stances here: the one within the story, centered on the boys; the `underwater' one (presumably the placeholder for what would be the folding in a better film and presaging some new awareness in the story); and the spoken narrator. These are separated by very clever sound editing and constitute the best element of the film. All the folding is done here: for instance, one road is blocked by a traffic death and later on a different road the narrator informs us that if they had been on that road tens years prior they would have seen an accident with similar social context.If you work hard, this spoken narration is sometimes clever but all in all you'd be far better off watching `Lucía y el sexo,' and celebrating hispanic passion: both sensual and intellectual.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw0728203"},{"movie":"Xia dao xiao","heading":"David Footballfield","date":"27 January 2010","content":"Western viewers will find this dull. I did. I am supposing that there are enough colloquial hooks to make it engaging for its target audience. It certainly seems to be narrowly focused on Chinese Singaporeans. If you do not know this, it is three short films by the same fellow, a local humorist. The \"where got ghost?\" theme is distributed in three places: Roadside, Forest and Home. Each is played for comedy.You might like this, as I did, as an exercise in going further to enter the film's world than the filmmaker provided for. He very clearly assumed that you would of course resonate to the cultural jokes. It is assumed that you will naturally understand the local superstitions of this one (of four) culture in this tiny nation. They are quite unreachable, which makes them all the more alluring. They all have to do with manipulated fate.It is easy to go even deeper though and try to get behind the specific structure of the thing. This is not composed structure we are talking about here, at least I think not. But it is there. All three set up the world so that there is no such thing as luck. There are three places to stand: in the movie itself as hapless nitwits. As the viewer, a position clearly reified. And in the position of the ghosts, who here are all-powerful but still conforming to a (rather illogical) code. The people in the story aren't quite people: There is much made of the 4D lottery, and you get the feeling that these people are no more than lottery numbers. The structure comes from how the power of the viewer as a sort of ghost is woven into and sort of competes with the powers of the on-screen ghosts. In the last segment, we even see the ghost on TeeVee! In the middle segment, there is a sort of middle existence, where characters transition from humans to half-ghosts. It is strange, unfamiliar, and a bit titillating.There are two effective cinematic moments, at the end of the two earlier segments. The spell in the first segment it triggered by the theft of some oranges. As our dummy lays dying in the road, we see hundreds of oranges roll toward him as we have an overhead shot.The second effect is the result of an elaborate setup, involving trees, a house, magic that is real magic pretending to be fake, and a sudden transition.

In fact, this movie will probably be forgotten two weeks after the Matrix sequel appears.But on the other hand, sometimes these projects are so costly, and have such a large distributed creative team that risk drives the thing to the ordinary.

The Donners have a reputation for having a deep understanding of how film works and how to intelligently exploit it. So I expected at least a few things excellent.We DO get movement. We DO have one fight sequence that is well crafted - aptly between the two combatants that are uniquely enhanced by technology. But the sets are amazingly, shockingly, scandalously unimaginative. The little soap opera is predictable and trivial enough - a Marvel legacy. The characters are generally flat. In the comic, they are - compared to other comics - human; here - compared to other film characters - cartoons. Huge Actman overacts hugely in a parody of Russell Crowe. Stewart does his continuing impression of what Shakespeare might do for TeeVee. For some reason the kids here are turned into, well, kids. The only mildly interesting characters are:-Famke Janssen. She is a very limited actress, but all such professional lives find that one role that is perfect for them. Everything about her fits, especially compared to the other women who are somewhat less limited as actresses. That hair color is something.

Some explanation and setup is given for the impending invasion and then we encounter the unrelenting but slowly moving threat. Here, we have a different formula: one we have tested with Tom Cruise and Will Smith: we are involved in everyday tedium and then bang! Explanations come later.How do you innovate with this, make it more compelling? You leverage the effect mentioned in a moment. A tsunami builds. No one knows what is happening. You only know that people are desperate to flee at any cost and the panic is the initial horror. What could cause this? The pacing is perfectly timed to outrun our ability to absorb what is going on, just as it is for our on- screen folks.Even in the midst of this shared confusion, we note that our hero has a different relationship to panic. (We know he is the hero only because he is Brad Pitt and that this film is produced by him for himself). He alone seems to absorb what is happening faster than anyone else, including us. We see him notice without knowing what he is understanding.This is the highest level of craft, it seems to me, focused on the hardest part of the story, the beginning.A second notable feature is what got this movie made, I suppose. The threat, at least in the first 2/3 of the movie, the original bits, is not zombies but zombie waves. Elsewhere I have written about using architectural water as a threat. A major advance was Perfect Storm and later Titanic where water could be given behavior, personality. Then we had Hereafter, where Eastwood directed a tsunami with intent.What we see here is mobs rendered as flows, and the CG processes being those used for water working against gravity. There is genius in this as well, and a genuine advance in the art. (This comment is on the two-d version. I cannot see how a three-d-ization could improve anything.)We also have a couple sections of good writing (noticed by my writer partner). These are placed where we expect to hear boring exposition, something about military labs or space probes. Something dreary but necessary. The first instance is with the Harvard genius who we are told is our best hope for understanding. he gives a speech instead about the capricious weakness of violent nature. It is a magnificent short speech, and then this last hope is dispatched.The second great hope is also a trope: the Jewish doctor. His speech is well crafted as well. It runs against what we expect from the genre; no exposition. It also runs against what we expect from the WASPy Harvard guy. It is instead a meditation on perception, something which furthers the (at that point still undeveloped) special power of our hero.This thing falls apart in the ordinary challenge of wrapping up a story. You can tell where a weak last third was pasted on. Now the zombies become individuals again and the storyline stops countering the genre.

It is all the more strange because the man behind this project is a troubled soul indeed, someone apparently without much talent himself. But it works because we have actorsIt works because Welles' genius was in the storytelling itself. He understood that so thoroughly well that he could exploit learned technologies, accidents, opportunistic talent, and a multitude of whims in such a way that each added to the visual narrative. Stories. And that's what we have here, mostly stories told about Welles by theater people. Because they are theater people themselves, they are pretty good at telling these stories, especially as they have already told and refined them hundreds of times.The Bogdonovich sequence really brought the whole thing down. He wrote a book on Welles, a project that Welles initiated and sanctioned. But he asked Bog to handle it precisely because he had all the crippled intellectualism Welles made fun of (on which Bog himself unknowlingly remarks). The book was intended like the `David and Goliath' task: a goof. Other low points were Graver's insistent display of his own adolescent films.Graver's own work since leaving Welles is an odd saga. He's done porn, and soft porn.

It was never about music, but about politics as religion, about the massive change of defining what it meant to be alive.You had to be immersed in the times to get a feel for how true this is. After the war (WWII), the US coasted on self-reinforcing images, images that had been created as a defense during that war. These images were fed by movies but the role was being taken over by popular music.Meanwhile, as as popular phenomenon, `folk' music was the stuff of the self-aware. Dylan, who controlled more of the nation's soul than anyone else living, completely shifted that from Folk to Rock at Newport. From that moment on, rock was the medium in which we invested ourselves to create new images to replace those of film. Onto this moving train jumped the Beatles and completely took control. These men changed the relationship of listener to artist: even masquerading as another band in their most influential album.But by the time of Woodstock, we the youth were adrift. Creating a vocabulary of images as aggressive and intellectual as we expected from early progress turned out to be impossible to sustain by individuals. Enter the `Music Industry' and supporting cultural niches.Woodstock was a spontaneous happening, but it happened for a very clear reason: we were yearning for a coherent mythology. Many of us went because we really expected to see both Dylan and The Beatles. Unbeknownst to us, The Beatles were already dead because of the same conflict we see in this film. The Beatles knew they led the future of the world, but disagreed bitterly on the core of that leadership: John pushed for drugged politics; Paul for Kabbalistic, surreal cosmology; George for kundalini; and simple Ringo for simple country music (then still called country and western).And we see exactly the same battle here in this film: a battle for influence over the structure of our minds. Still kicking were the folkies: dear Joan, Arlo and Richie. Against that: ironic rock (the Who, the Airplane); modern blues (Canned Heat, Joe Cocker, Janis); free jazz meditations (Jimi); pure goof (Sha Na Na); lush pop (CS & N); and popular country (Sebastian and `Country' Joe). Fit the rest in yourselves, all tussling for mass listenership, working to be the one that caught fire. In the background were various purveyors of watered down religious and political notions. Drugs were there, but they really had little to do with it, only being an excuse for discontinuity.Now the moment is gone. The hoped-for reinvention never really happened. What emerged were two cultures: one that followed a lobotomized popular music derived from country and one that pretended to be extreme based on various types of staged excess.Nixon won.In the final indignity, after the music disemboweled itself, the whole event is turned into a set of what? _Film Icons_. Many more millions of people see this film than ever were there, or for that matter participated in the east coast freak movement (east coast: intellectual `freaks' -- west coast: dropped out `hippies'). Those millions are massaged and reinforced by the visuals. The music probably won't mean anything by itself unless you were a part of it. It can't, the images wash the music out. In fact, today the video is what sells the song.But even within the film world are similar battles for how images are registered in our collective imaginations. Scorsese (who is responsible for the visual and narrative philosophy of this project) represents film images built around characters. It is a sad thing that he got this project rather than someone who understood the music. There are other cinematic philosophies, more powerful, less self-limiting. (Look at how Demme understands the Heads in \"Stop Making.\") I advise you to look elsewhere for both your understanding of this period and the manner in which you build your imagination.","id":"rw0113992"},{"movie":"Woo-ri aek-syeon-bae-woo-da","heading":"Dorm Room Trifles","date":"1 August 2009","content":"I saw this at the Melbourne International Film Festival. It was fantastic in large part because it was new. I saw it paired with \"Theater of War,\" whose idea was that little people enable unhealthy societies. That film presumed that structure in film and theater was what powered narrative in individuals and societies. It was a powerful notion: Top-down long form narrative influences individuals whose individual actions and commitment aggregate into societal impulse. Top to bottom, bottom to top.This is the opposite. It is purely all bottom. It is a documentary, about the making of a documentary by some stuntmen who participate in the making of movies. These movies are Korean action films where chaos is the baseline, and the illusion of chaos involves the stunts that these guys do. The form is that we have a female narrator, who also produces and is the girlfriend of one of the stuntmen. She gives a meandering account of the history of four stuntmen from the day they audition for stunt school. One of these guys — her boyfriend — has his history start at birth.The charm of this is that it has no narrative structure whatever. There are some notions introduced: the danger, the personal incompetences, the nature of the film business, the unevenness of the lives... But it is essentially a bunch of episodes and skits put together from what appears to be their actual unrehearsed lives, and stuff that is clearly fabricated. Its all the stuff of dorm room horsing around, a sort of nerd macho meets illusion. The lives are aimless. The movies they help make are aimless and the film we are watching is so aimless we keep waiting for it to either develop structure or end.And yet, it is so guileless, so human that there is enough that we follow.

The similarities and differences between the two are striking.Both have a quality of photography that is wonderful. Enough to justify the viewing by itself. Both have the fights much better integrated into the story than the typical `action film' from the West. Both have a rather high quality of acting.What I liked about the Woo film was its more intelligent, dynamic eye. The camera was choreographed as a character, giving a completely different cast to everything. It changes the nature of the narrative, and is much more cinematically sophisticated. The score adds.But so far as the sophistication of the story is concerned, this is a much deeper and intelligent film. The story is framed in the context of the imposition of western technology into a mature civilization. Movies are a part of that intrusion, in fact arguably the most intrusive. So we already have a self-referential conundrum. It is handled here deftly. The main action is based on a literal stage. That stage, incidentally is on a boat, and boats figure in other elements of the story. The love interest (who really is lovely) in a Chinese woman who travels to the west and brings back -- guess what -- a camera!So we have a play within a play, which is a rather well-known device. (I wish the play had been subtitled, because I am sure it would have meant something apt.) But we also have a much richer device: pictures about taking pictures. Our first exposure (sorry) is Aunt 13 taking a picture which could have killed the subject were it not for the alertness of the hero. I understand the old man who would have been killed would have been understood by a Hong Kong audience as someone who straddles the Chinese and film worlds.Later, the central institution is burned, at least the building that houses it: a combination Confucian healing place and martial arts academy from longstanding tradition. While it burns, this woman takes a picture. It is an incredibly rich image: intelligent, rich, lovely, deeply bothersome. At another time, she arranges for her shadow to caress his.Another element that makes this film rich: Jet Li is a real martial artist, not just a coached actor. The disciplines of martial art and acting overlap, with one amplifying the other.If you've seen the 2001 remake of `the Musketeer,' you should see this for the original of the ladder fight scene.

I stumbled upon him in `The Claim.' That film had a few powerful visions that accompanied well integrated narrative power. Some extremely deft camera notions. Exquisite enfolding of the music, which in that case was Nyman's as well.Now here is something even better in its own way. It just blows me away because it is so intimate. I remarked on another little film about this same intimacy in looking at her in : `Things You Can Tell By Just Looking At Her.' But here, there is a weaving and bobbing of the story, a similar weaving with the camera's eye, and an intense musical experience. The music, and camera is extraordinary alone. The acting seems special too, but I suspect it is ordinarily fine. The merger is the thing.I'm usually satisfied with just a remarkable camera. DePalma for instance has a magical camera, but he keeps a sterile distance from his actors. Greenaway as well, and he used Nyman in exceptional ways. Not so here. This is what Aranofsky attempts: having the camera inhabit the personal space created among actors. The space is a little wider here because of the `Short Cuts' platespinning. But the camera and music are much, much closer to the bone than in anything I have seen since `Vanya on 42nd Street.'I see a huge number of films, but with this one, I was transported to the drift of their lives.

(The other is Ridley Scott.) Here he tries to inject art and majesty in a common vehicle. To remain true to the vehicle, he must use a thin story (though with numerous threads) and an understated acting style. I think this understated focus on faces helps make the subtitles more palatable than they would be otherwise. They are also larger and higher than normal, so one's eye doesn't have to jump so much from face to word. There's no question that this film was conceived with the western reading eye in mind.Lee pumps up the skeleton well enough with grand vistas and wonderful sets. The vision is surreal, which befits the mythical drama. In this and several other ways, he greatly surpasses the `Star Wars' feel. I must say that the final cave/warehouse was too theatrical -- it just didn't fit the rest. Some of the mattes are annoyingly fakey. The bambootop fight was ungraceful. But those are relative nits.What I wanted in this film was a whole new level in choreographing the CAMERA during fight scenes. I know this is a hot topic among directors just now, and think he is quite up to the challenge. He has already shown mastery of the inside, emotional camera, and the notion of bringing this to dance excited me. He teases with some spectacular camera movement, but it is always in a conventional frame. Guess he wanted to sell a lot of tickets instead of reinvent the medium.What I mean: with the fights, you have several characters, the two (or howevermany) fighters, the swords, the viewer and the camera. In a good film, some of these will merge. In a masterful production that merger will shift so that the camera is the sword, the viewer, then the fighter. (Here, the green sword IS a central fighter.) But add to that the complication of the idiom: each fighter and weapon is actually just a token for the master. Each fight is a battle between invisible characters, whose perspective the camera can also take.Lee plays these fights too safe, and it really annoys because he shows us ever so fleetingly what he can do. Sometimes, the camera is the sword, sometimes the master, but in teasing glimpses only. He's concerned with making sense, and that requires sticking to convention. Maybe as he gets older, he'll do this again, but with more multidimensional vision, more enlightenment, less concern for the general viewer.But check out the fight scores. This drummer knows the dimensions we're talking about, because he follows Lee's camera when it leaves the body. Cool.This film also has the sexiest literary scene I've ever experienced. (And that counts the lush \"Pillow Book.\") It will be worth owning for that 15 seconds alone. Watch Jen's calligraphy, obviously done by a master.

Hearing him talk of his films, one gets bored easily. His films are simply conceived, like Lynch's, but once he gets rolling, his intuitions take him to strange, exotic corners of the soul. There he leaves traces that last. I love the man's work, much of it. I love the fact that he really seems to be driven by urges that seem to accidentally result in something that can cross the distribution divide to reach me. This is no small feat; the films I watch that have ideas and matter are what  maybe a millionth, a billionth? of the similarly deep insights and artifacts that would have similar effect in me, but which cannot cross that divide.When I watch his work, some of which I reserve for the future, it is a dip into the film of Herzog. Failures add to this. Risks that did not pan out for him, do for me.This film has some heavy disadvantages. He is in Australia and he simply does not understand that to photograph the land the way it affects its inhabitants, you have to photograph nothing. Nothing is what matters. But he gives us a tornado. Its beautiful and violent  it even fits the story. He gives us unrelenting piles of boring waste. This too is effective in the film, but not of the place.He misses both the place and he people. He does give us beautiful Aboriginal faces. He does celebrate them. But its from a deeply disturbing patriarchal, colonial perspective. There is some of this in his Peruvian adventures, but it is hidden in his respect for the Jungle. The natives are simply part of the terrain. He cannot do that here. This also suffers in that he felt it necessary to have an on-screen observer who \"learns\" the value of the place and turns from heading the mining effort to living with the people.The result is that the film is overt in its sentiments, but everything works against its honesty. We are left with having to accept it locally, each scene as a sort of standalone taste: black patient faces staring out of pilot seats in an airplane given to them; a man on a witness stand testifying in a language no other soul on the planet understands; an old biddy waiting in the sun at a mine opening on the of chance that her beloved doggie will reappear; that tornado; the (overearnest) story of the sleeping green ants whose dreams we are.This has value in those small pieces, pretty much throughout.

It isn't any of those French guys; in fact my history starts with Harriot and goes through Wittgenstein, then to theorists in logical narrative. (No, not Peirce.) Wittgenstein is a fascinating guy to study, in part because his ideas are clean, very clean. But more important was that over time he abandoned every one of them, replacing them with something more subtle, elegant and hard to reach. The ideas in \"Tractus\" were his earliest and while some nice phrases can be extracted for posters, if they are worth reading at all, its worth reading the repudiation of them.Still, anything that draws from even the first Wittgenstein trumps any silliness you will find in \"What the bleep,\" \"Tao of Steve,\" or \"Waking Life.\"This is a very ambitious film. It has these components: text of Wittgenstein phrases from the Tractus and private statements about his own life and psyche, with that same text spoken in different time. It shows \"found\" home movie segments (though some are apparently faked). These are silent of course but have some appropriate sound effects added. The era of the images varies quite a bit, most from the 50s it seems. Tractus is from about 1919. There is an effective score as well.So we have several things in parallel, what I call \"folded.\" We are given this man's life. He was profoundly bipolar, what we now call bipolar and some of his philosophical (and architectural!) musings were specifically to counter suicide (like his brothers). We are given some very strong ideas from Tractus, which deals with the distance among the three concepts: \"picture,\" \"world,\" and \"language.\" To use images from the world in apparently random ways (except the editing rhythm) and written and spoken language to illustrate these ideas is a brilliant notion.We have the distance between the ideas, the distance between each of the images, and the distance among the components of what we see: its first, second and third meanings. One phrase: \"everything you see could be otherwise,\" permeates. I saw this together with \"Cremaster 2\" and this for its flaws was vastly superior. It floats above meaning but has meaning. It shows something that must be incomprehensible but must also be. One registration: all the home movies are of Hungarians. Wittgenstein was Austrian; Vienna and Budapest were cities of the same empire until Tractus and afterward Hungary began a long slide toward internalism.So forgive the filmmaker for not getting deeper into the ideas.

He felt that Greenaway was excessive pretentious and juvenile and suggested this film as `real' intelligent filmmaking. I really wanted to discover a new director, so watched with expectation.About the actual art of the filmmaking, I can report that this to be completely mundane. The technique is of stationary filming of a staged play with no risk and little imagination.But the topic has real promise! Wittgenstein is among the dozen most fascinating men of ideas who ever lived. He anticipated the core ideas about logic and language that are commonplace today. But he was profoundly not influential. All these ideas were reinvented by independent means because his explications were so abstruse. I believe them to be necessarily so, and we still don't appreciate the full ambiguities he noted.This is grand, fascinating stuff, but in this play we get the most trivial inklings of his middle period. How sad.Independent of the ideas, his life is remarkable. He was rich and gave it away. He absolutely mastered a strain of philosophical thought and was universally celebrated (though not understood). He tossed it away, disclaiming all his ideas and starting over as his own most powerful detractor. And he did this thrice! He went from the protection of the university to hovels and degradation multiple times. Along the way he designed one of the most puzzling houses on the planet. This is great, great stuff.But this film is motivated by a politico-sexual agenda, so while watering down the great intellectual and physical swings, ascribes them to repressed guilt of his sexuality. Wittgenstein would be appalled, I think, to have his great projects and discipline so debased. In fact, he seemed to have repressed guilt about everything he could conceive, and among these homosexuality was a lesser driver because the environment was so accepting, even encouraging. Alan Turing of the next generation, is a different, more apt story.The report then is that this is not cinematically interesting, and some great drama has been missed in order to make a minor -- and perhaps untrue -- point.","id":"rw0332025"},{"movie":"Åklagarens vittne","heading":"Untrusted Means of Untrusted Narration","date":"9 April 2005","content":"Christie is one of our most treasured and adventuresome experimenters in narrative twisting and knotting.

It looks like \"Barry Lyndon\" to me, without the gloss. There is literally tons of atmosphere: fog, rain, smoke, dew and just filth in the air.It has the tone of \"The Dresser\" in terms of being actors about acting and tragically so.

It disguises itself as a TeeVee death-movie character study. Instead, it is a highly literate exploration of the power of words. The idea is that words ARE ideas, that representations are reality, that actors are real (can directly address the audience), and that all of these provide a platform for selfawareness.I suppose some folks might actually think the point of all this had to with cancer and the pathos of a woman's death, or the skill of such a portrayal. But I believe it is crafted to elicit precisely that notion and then destroy it. The story is not about cancer, but about WATCHING cancer. The doctors are not healers, but observers. We are not passive watchers, but observers that are addressed directly. Emma is an actress watching the whole process, a professor observing herself and only incidentally a woman dying.Donne invented the notion of life as an observation. Pinter spend a career as self- referential writer exploiting the layers of story and representation of the story. See the gold standard: \"French Lieutenant's Woman.\" Here he plays the erudite father who gives the epiphany of words. Here we have Emma who has rewritten the play to emphasize the dramatic layers, that same Emma who did the same for Austen. Here, we even have Beatrix Potter, who was used in much the same way (to reference dramatic layers) in \"Myth of Fingerprints.\"We even have Chris Lloyd as the archetypical observer, reversing his \"Cuckoo\" role to emphasize the layers.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.","id":"rw0724163"},{"movie":"The Return of Sherlock Holmes:Wisteria Lodge","heading":"Mirrored","date":"11 March 2006","content":"By now you probably know that the Holmes series, like most of its ilk, has a production formula that changes everything each time excepting the main characters and few sets.This is the worst effort of all the ones that feature Brett, and is oddly paired in the same DVD as the best.Its not worth commenting on the story. The producers decided to not have any of these be mysteries in the writerly sense that you are given clues and weave wits with Holmes. Instead, they think you will be happy with a clever surprise at the end.But still with those constraints, we can get a director and writer that tries to interpret the detection cinematically and succeed. Obviously the producers so specified because each episode tries a different trick. Some are apt, some not. Aptness aside, many fail.The device here is mirrors. There must be a score of shots where the action is seen in a mirror, usually composed as a dynamic object in the frame. There are directors who know how to use this. Tarkovsky built an entire essay on it and the idea of inner rumination as reflected reality is in the first couple weeks of film school.But this fails, alas.

This also happens to be my country, and in fact -- though I will never know the details -- my dad was in this action. This has the required swelling of patriotic fervor at the end, and does so with a minimum of racist demonization.Its about the one really risky time in the war. There was never any doubt that the Germans (and Italians) would lose in Europe once the US entered the war; the only question was the cost. But in the Pacific, the situation was truly dire between Pearl Harbor and this battle. After this battle, it was a war of factories.But before, it was touch and go. Everyone in the States would have known the pivotal role of the event and would have their stories about tactics and bravery. There are three notable things about this movie.The first is that it is nearly all wrong in terms of the history. The reason for this is that the US had broken the code (JN-25). This was not something that could be announced; the US knew the details of the Japanese plans and were able to stage an ambush. But that hardly explains the other, gratuitous historical inaccuracies. One can only think that no one cared what the actual tactics were as long as communal dedication was apparent.A second rather shocking thing is that all the combat footage is genuine. These are real warriors in the real place, with less than half of the movie (obviously overlain) produced as a fiction. Looking at these men and operations deepens the experience, knowing how rare it is to see this before Vietnam.But the most interesting to me is one character. He's pretty much the central character of the fiction: a torpedo plane pilot. Now picture this; you have a real story of national import around which history does swing. You have actual footage which in other, later, contexts with narration stands strong. You have all this and you want to insert Hollywood; what do you do?Well, you insert a character who is a Hollywood actor, someone who has left Hollywood and enlisted but who still carries his Oscar on combat missions! Its yet another example of this phenomenon I call the narrative fold. Pretty cool.Oh, the fictional parts are bad in nearly all respects, excepting one scene. An airman has been killed and his buddy is packing his effects for transport back to his girl. Going through things to place in a suitcase, he finds an empty tube of toothpaste and tosses it in the trash.

Already, we have notions of taxonomy, flight and architecture made cinematic by suggestion. If I had to reduce his talent to one notion, it would be that power of suggestion  the ability to take a collection of surveyors tools (usually in terms of layers, manifolds, counting and accounting, and dissecting) and tease a semantics out of images by overlaying those tools on the images.No one else does this. No one at all. It is no surprise because of the difficulties. Even Greenaway fails often (M, Dante and Belly come to mind).This is not the first early film of his you should see.

After all, movie love is pretty thin stuff when you boil it down. So about a decade ago, date movie scripts started borrowing from other genres. In particular the writers borrowed the trick of focusing on the audience instead of the couple in question. The reason is that you can only go so far in making the couple appealing and attractive. So if you want to make the audience closer to caring, well you just relocate the audience.Therefore, we have a slew of date movies set in public arenas so that the audience can have a clear surrogate on screen. Usually this is done by setting the movie in movieland. This way we can have a movie audience watching a movie/TeeVee audience watching the couple. When they cheer, we cheer.Perhaps the most closely engineered of these was \"Notting Hill.\" In that case a popular actress plays a popular actress. She has a constant on-screen audience not unlike the audience in the theater who were drawn to the film because of Ms Roberts.These projects must have a climax where the love (after some screwup) is proclaimed to the on screen audience. They clap and cheer. We clap and cheer. We've had these with Meg, Julia, Sandra, Catherine and so on, each in turn.Okay. Here we have the latest refinement. They are not about to play with the general shape: two people fall in love in instant movie fashion; they are pulled apart by some events; he announces his love in a very public manner to an on-screen audience thereby making it \"real.\" The boundary between movie love and real love is crossed and we leave the theater feeling happy.The innovation here is the crossing with a sports film using an internal narrative. You can just hear the machinery dropping into place as the screenwriter thought of the formula. Or perhaps he just went to one of the several consultants (like myself) who come up with these schemes.The internal narrative is clever indeed. Usually in a sports movie we (and our screen surrogates) watch the performer, only inferring what is going on in his (usually his) mind. The less we know explicitly the better because our imagination is usually stronger than what they can display. Think of \"Bull Durham.\"But here, we are sometimes in the male's mind (literally hearing his thoughts), sometimes in the normal audience's and sometimes in the on-screen audience's (including the hackneyed announcers-in-the-booth). Shifting back and forth (mirrored by the back and forth of the ball) and adding the idea that he himself is a watcher and wonderer is pretty clever.But the whole thing falls apart at the production level.

As a result, this one misses the mark that `Lord of the Rings' hits. It is not as charming as `Dark Crystal' nor as much fun as `Princess Bride.' So I cannot recommend it on its merits directly. You may be interested in George Lucas' experiments with Joseph Campbell's observations on myth, but I'm not.What does interest me is how he handles one, narrow archetype, the redhead. Willow wears a red wig. The babys hair has been colored bright red, as has Sorsha's and the baby's mother. (Whalley's hair is rather odd looking, because they didn't adjust the facial makeup to match.) Heck, George even got a redhead to direct.I believe there is something special about redheads in film. (Naturally, this says little or nothing about redheads in real life, so no need to send me mail.) Since Clara Bow, and then Hayworth and Hayward, the red has always carried a collection of nuances that filmmakers can use as a shortcut.Truffault explored this in `Day for Night' where the magic of the women was in proportion to how red their hair was, complicated by wigs going on and off. I think Lucas, wanting to be a `serious' filmmaker, was experimenting with some of these same ideas, but with immaturity.Howard doesn't understand how to photograph women.

Each of the characters presents according to their narrative constraints. The guy is a photographer, so works with movie- based images. Indeed the whole thing could be seen as a movie fantasy played out in a glance at a video shop. The original love is a dancer, and is limited to a narrative bound by physical presence.The alternative love is an actress playing an actress. More, just as Josh's film (and drug haze) is folded into this movie, so is Rose's play within the play - which happens to be Shakespeare's 'Twelfth Night' where lovers' identities are switched... and which contains its own internal folding. It is a sweet construction that is more of a complex idea and incomplete sketch than a mature narrative. But it has some strong moments when the Shakespeare play is happening (and unhappening as you see Rose remove her makeup in a backwards application). In comparison, the shoe thing is clumsy.As it unravels, it becomes a mere con for love. The end is unsatisfactory, radically compromised to be 'happy.' But who loved the strongest?

I have yet to find two from 2005 I would put on this list. But I already have two from 1932 and want to put this one on it. One of those is \"Freaks,\" surely one of the most effective movies of all time, not just because of its cinematic power, but the obvious reality that the characters are playing much themselves.The other \"must see\" is currently \"Mask of Fu Manchu,\" something so visually novel it stirs deep. So I cannot put this on my list of what I call \"4's,\" but let me state here that you really must see this.Yes, for me it is better than the early Draculas and Frankensteins. They have power, but through repetition, refinement that surrounds the experience. But essentially they are literary horror. This is the first major, talking horror film (other than \"Freaks\") that is purely envisioned cinematically.It has a sappy ending. And a few of the sets seem unnaturally flat. But its something that weaves the skin.That's because instead of wangling with science and God like Frankenstein, or virgin's blood and what is effectively gypsy magic  it is directly American in striking at race and sex.The race component is typically American in its presentation. This is black man's magic, but it is performed by a white man, Lugosi in fine form. More than any other monster actor, Lugosi's later projects deepened his presence in the earlier ones. He really is a marvelously spooky guy and I have Ed Wood to thank for the creepiest Lugosi.Its black man's magic, but if you look, all the zombies are white men. The key posse is directly white. Of the many slaves, some are white and others seem like they are whites in blackface, all cast because they have tortured blankness. The very idea of this is offputting.The story is simple: a man on a voyage falls in love, but the target of his affection is already engaged to a feckless fellow. He entices the couple to his Haitian home to be wed. Meanwhile, he arranges from the Lugosi character to turn her into a zombie for his sexual pleasure, a love slave.We know from the very first scene that Lugosi lusts after the same china doll virgin. Our original man gets his prize, a sex slave. But she is soulless, emptyeyed. And he decides sex with her isn't what he imagined, so he goes back to Lugosi to ask that her soul be returned. He would rather have passion as hate than passionless love.That's when Lugosi decides to take the girl for himself. It ends in a silly scuffle.But along the way, there's a cool effect. How Lugosi turns his victims into zombies is by making an image, a detailed carving of the target in candlewax, presumably beeswax.Its a clever idea, one I call folding. We are watching an image on screen, and he wants to turn a real character (who is in turn not real, merely played) into an image of herself. Once the waxen image is perfected, it is melted, destroyed. Then he can control what's left with his stare and interlocked hands.So that we can get the full meaning of the sexual intent, we are shown this doll in the underwear preparing for her wedding with magical sounds out her window. Then she is taken before her virginity is.The scene where her captor decides her languor is intolerable is something. She is playing the piano. It is music written for the movie, but clearly in emulation of Chopin. That composer is known for music that a strong soul can fill with immense passion. Here it really is passionless. Compare this to the usually opposite effect: Johnny Depp playing Chopin with a corpse, Liv Ullman an other wise soulless woman playing, and similarly the empty Jack Nicholson. \"Corpse Bride,\" \"Autumn Sonata\" and \"Five Easy Pieces.\" Ah, the horrible power of talkies.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw1441826"},{"movie":"Den vita stormen","heading":"Water","date":"4 April 2004","content":"Spoilers herein.Some things are inherently cinematic: explosions/fireworks, cars, architecture... and water.Water is a challenge though.

There's a different sort of pleasures in working with films from ordinary talents. There's stuff there to build on, plenty.But what's really peculiar in my life of film are the conversations I have with moderate talents, especially ones I encounter often. Eastwood is one of these folks, someone with enough juice and craft to register, but not enough to do something with his architecture. He id something really first rate in \"Mystic River\" but immediately before and after went back to manufactured goods. That \"Mystic\" had the element of \"outsideness\" that he sometimes understands, all the way back to Leone. A modern expression of that has the outsider as the director and in \"Mystic\" involved actors all of whom he asked to direct their own scenes.Here the folding formula is simpler. The filmmaker playing a filmmaker, who incidentally was of the same stripe creatively (craft-centered and sometimes intuitively brilliant). His buddy (and the only other character that exists), is writing the screenplay of the movie within, and also wrote the screenplay of he outer movie. He is a superobserver to whom Eastwood's character knows he has to play.The story is so simple as to not exist: there is Life, Africa, Film, Being Observed, all of these conflated into a simple drama. Its my impression that Eastwood understood much of this. You can see it in the last few seconds where his character actually starts to direct. There's an integration of self and work that obviously eludes everyone, especially the designated observer.

While they are from competing studios, there are a few references to \"Kane\" here, including a couple notes about the famous \"War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast.The setup is pretty delicious. Red Skelton is a radio star, who plays a detective called the Fox. This by itself is a joke because the man's humor is all in his face. He is dependent on film — and later TeeVee to be successful. He is famous (in this movie) for writing complex mysteries, not for performing them.Superficially, the story has him kidnapped by the bad guys and forced to come up with a foolproof murder idea. He does, but is able to foil the plot. Bad guys are captured. All is well. But look at how this is done.The bad guys operate a fake spiritualist cult that sells a \"radio\" service to the departed. In order to keep their enterprise going, they will get a million dollars if they kill some innocent guy and get away with it. So the deal is fake radio versus real, and cleverly solved mystery versus cleverly concealed mystery.As a sort of mirror, Red's character has two women in love with him, and they are kidnapped with him. Many of the jokes have to do with the confusion and conflict between these. The payoff is in how Red's character foils his own plot. He literally — I am not making this up — figures out a way to talk backwards into a radio receiver. Now I believe that this sort of construction is no accident. But I also hold that it is not an intellectual exercise either. Narrative folding comes as naturally as a sort of analogy-based equivalent of the puns on which this is based. (Red's radio show is sponsored by a soft drink. When capturing him, the cult wants him to sell a drink in an identical bottle that contains Vitamin O. )Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw2264792"},{"movie":"Whistling in the Dark","heading":"Metawriting","date":"22 April 2007","content":"In the early thirties, EVERY film that gathered an audience was important. EVERY narrative trick that worked was adopted and manhandled, forming the ancestry of how our dreams become known.I'm more interested in the detective story than others of this period. But I'm also interested in the contributors to what would become noir. I'm convinced it has its roots in self-reflexive stories, like this one here. In fact this one is quite important because of its prominence. It was a successful stage play before it was a movie, and the movie features the same two lead actors.The story is folded in a simple way, not complex at all. Only later would the jumps between folds become accepted.The setup is simple. You have mobsters, already by 1933 mostly an invention of film and radio. They want to murder someone and cannot figure out how. The world's greatest mystery playwright happens to get stranded in their remote hideaway and they force him to \"write\" a perfect murder that will be accomplished in the movie. See the fold, a writer in a movie writing a movie?The fold is made more explicit in the way the murder is foiled. I mentioned radio above. Radio was the great medium of the period, not films. Think TeeVee. The way most folks would have received their mob and mystery stories would be through the radio. The plot device here is impossible in real life, but what happens is that the writer (and his fiancé) are locked in a room and turn an ordinary radio into a phone which they use to communicate the story in the opposite direction than usual, it becoming a two-way device.The fold is underscored by the humor of their guard being in the room and not getting that the radio is really a channel to an audience. So there's a joke between what he knows and what we know the writer does.Its not all that great as entertainment. Few of these are, but then few films of any era are. But this one gives you some proto narrative DNA, and if you watch for it, it'll meta-titillate. Oh, speaking of that, the fiancé is played by Una Merkel who was the roommate in \"The Redheaded Woman,\" just before.

It is the emotional center of the thing. I'll be more interested here in noting the cinematic use of space. Jonze is famous for this, and how he can connect it to the folds in the narrative.\"Folds\" in this context have to do with nesting of narrative elements. For instance the \"real world\" segments feature eating (twice), fort (twice), snowball fight, wild suit, pileon, pulling at toes, lost marriage, broken model of a heart, being king, son/sun dying and so on. The \"wild world\" features the same things twisted in ways that suggest the real narrative describing the inner character of Max. This \"folding\" gives us a place to stand and engages us more deeply, as a key narrative device. There is even a smaller inner fold where Carol (the Max surrogate) makes a model of his world, hidden in the desert. And another where Max enters KW.I am more interested in the spatial folding. Yup, the way that Jonze has decided to set up and elaborate a vocabulary of movement.Here's what we have, I think. I have only seen this once and will have to wait for DVD study to confirm it.The scenes I am working with here are the ones with physical motion, where both the camera and the subjects move: the dogchasing, snowball fight, the amazing encounter with the waves when approaching the island, the rumpus and then the dirtball fight. Frozen motionpaths are in the fort's appendage, the \"pile,\" and indicated by the stickweaving in the global fort and houses.I believe these all use the same motion template. When someone invents a movie annotation tool where we can find and describe this, it will be easy to check and show. Right now it is an impression, but I got the feeling when watching that wave scene (in IMAX) that I would see the same motion paths in the forthcoming rumpus. Perhaps it was the appearance of the ululating sound that was used every time something got frantic, and by that time twice already. Perhaps it was the obvious reference to the Hokusai woodblock (\"The Great Wave off Kanagawa\"), where a wild wave becomes an actor, a wild thing dwarfing an iconic mountain, whose shape I thought I also saw on-screen.I would not be surprised either if Spike used a sigla to denote this motion (like Joyce does in \"Finnegans Wake\") and that the sigla was KW, denoting the actual paths, the K in plan and the W in the vertical plane. Thus, KW swallowing/eating Max, apart from the obvious vaginal association also takes on a deeply cinematic one, worthy of \"Adaptation.\" I know the work on this was done in Melbourne. Could it be that this apparent one-man shop \"Digital Rein\" managed this? In an unconnected area, am I misremembering? I recall the phrase was \"Let the Wild Rumpus Begin!\" (not \"start\").Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw2150507"},{"movie":"Lukten av pengar","heading":"Paul Acting Someone who is Acting","date":"21 April 2000","content":"I always ask, why did this movie get made? In this case, the answer is easy: Paul Newman wants to `keep his hand in' to `exercise his chops.' Paul has been a very fine actor in his later career and what do actors in school value the most? Why it's playing a role where the character is acting. So here we have Paul playing a brilliant old man who is acting brilliantly, using Paul's method.The whole setup is to allow Paul to explain (and show) how he internalizes until every heartbeat is Sinatra. And you can see him acting his heart out when he's just drooping in the wheelchair. It is worth it for just that, if you are interested in fine acting.The story is weak but I suspect it was not originally so. In fact, I delayed this review for a week so I could ask around. It seems the original story emphasized Paul's struggle between acting and the sexual attraction of Florentino. Much of the original story was his scheming to get the girl. Apparently, the test groups washed this out and the story was re-edited to be more sting-like. Early reviewers saw a more earthy version.I was also interested in the director. The first few minutes are masterful, up until the arrival of Paul at the hospital. Thereafter, we have fairly pedestrian pacing. Who is this guy? I was unable to discover, but I imagine him as a quirky film intellectual that Paul selected, and who may disappear for another decade after how the studio hosed this film around.See it if you honor the art of acting, and can get behind a homeopathic approach, less and less is more and more until you are acting someone acting a stroke victim.

Joan Cusack as always is an underappreciated master of timing.Natalie is not a serious actress, but could be some day. Until then, she should stay away from the manufactured southern accent and pseudophilosphical monologues. Ashley Judd is a weak talent in an embarrassing role. Channing and Frain have been competent I think in the right vehicle, but here they are given simple balloons to inflate.\nHere's an observation that will ruin many movies for you: when an actor is in over his/her depth, when they are TRYING so hard to act but just don't have the stuff other than an iron will to try...when this happens, they speak out of the right side of their mouths only. It's a right-brain/left-brain thing that you just can't escape. Watch Harrison Ford when the demands of the art are greater than trivial. And watch it here with MIT grad Dylan Bruno where the demands of the part are barely trivial.

Devotion in any endeavor is something we are drawn to, and there is plenty for our filmmaker to harvest.The essential part of this film is Herzog as camera during a gathering in India, where a variety of consecrations are planned. Monks and devotees come, some by difficult and humbling means. 400,000 faces (all attempting calmness) are miraculously organized, assembled to be led by the supreme priest.We see queues so orderly they could only exist among such beings, but anxious chaos when fighting for tossed goodies: dumplings and candies. We have zealots, order and peace.Into this sails Herzog. The story is that he had been cajoled into filming the much smaller gathering in Austria. Austria! He was reluctant to do so, and after the film remains firm in his belief that Austrian Buddhists don't make much sense to him. But with this commitment, he traveled to the gathering in a sacred place in India near Nepal.There he found a focus for his film in one of the rituals. Though it is presented as central to the gathering, it is only so in Herzog's vision. This holds that mysteries can be conveyed visually. The situation needs to support the vision, but the vision is the thing. It is not the symbol, the notation, the token, but the real thing. This is how he thinks of cinema and the way he presents the sand mandala carries this import.The \"Wheel of Time\" is one translation of a sand painting made for this type of gathering, as perfected and maintained by one of the groups in Tibet. Mandalas are movies and intended for meditation, as a structure existing between and shared by the mind of insight and the real world of color and structure. There is much to be said of them and cinema, but Herzog only could film this one (and its copy in Austria) as it is being made with colored sand and exhibited as devotees are rushed past it.He then went to Mount Kailash, Though this is a couple hundred miles away, he merges it seamlessly into the gathering of nearly half a million robed prayers. Here, he is able to make some magnificent images of the mountain, its waterways and the people ritualistically circumnavigating it. This is holiness he understands and the conflation of mountain and mandala works. As usual, the music adds great power. I believe that henceforth, I will associate that music with this devotion, though there is no relation other than Herzog chose to build his mandala of these sounds, this extract of natural rock and water, and these people. They would not recognize their devotions as shown here. (And some of this is staged.)

Maxwell's equations were every bit as revolutionary as relativity or quantum mechanics would be later. The new age religion of the era was spiritualism, the belief in the afterlife and the ability to cross into it.As surely as snow falls, religion will appropriate the prevailing cosmology for its own ends. A century ago that was science and so it is today. Then, the appropriation of Maxwell's insights on electromagnetism was an amazing confabulation of \"animal magnetism\" and vibrational resonance. We don't use the term \"Mesmerism\" any more, but in any new age bookshop, you'll still see references to vibrations. The notion of \"auras\" is from this era.Every time science produces new tools, it gets swallowed by folks hungry for some \"explanation\" of what they would believe in any case. So when there was a new notion of relative time, you had a slew of religious notions woven around it. You can trace the main ones to Ouspensky and Gurdjieff. In that case, psychism and reincarnation found scientific explanations.Quantum mechanics affords much greater flexibility for the next generation of appropriators, the era we are now in. That's because it has intrinsic mystical features even for the staid physicists who use it.This movie has three parts. The first merges quantum physics with ordinary life. The second introduces a theory of consciousness that enfranchises individual cells (here shown in animation) with intent and agency. And the third part merges the two in a way that suggests you can control at least your own body and perhaps the physics of the space around you. Its all linked to QM.The problem is that these folks start with the convincing notion that we live in a world of inadequate models. That's a good insight. Then they introduce QM as if it really was the way the world works. It isn't, folks. Its just another model, and a very, very problematic one at that. In physics, it doesn't even work in the most common force in physics, gravity.It has absolutely no utility or meaning in the fields of chemistry, biology, and all the social and cognitive sciences that are the lions share of where we actually live. And even where it applies, it applies at scales that are so tiny the notion of \"observer\" becomes laden with artificial baggage.There are very serous scientists who are dedicated to eliminating it as a theoretical tool because it reduces the world to numbers, the most ridiculously blunt abstraction. Just because you find a physicist with a PhD, doesn't mean you've found someone who understands the limits of the method.The real sadness about this is that there really is a mystical vision to be had here. Its one that works with the notion of notation always being ephemeral. These smoothtalking purveyors of happiness are our worst enemy because they simply substitute one mythology for another. You owe it to yourself to study the issues here well enough to discard them.Otherwise, you might as well just give up and do what the man wants.I usually like watching movies made by religious zealots.

One of these is to decide which of the small number of positions they will take on just what an actor is.Many of these can be aligned from the extremes of `instrument' to `composer.' The `instrument actors' are those who believe their job is to be an interpreter of whatever art has been created before they arrive on the scene.Then, in regular quanta, we have discrete types of actors who add something of themselves, sometimes emotional `truth` (in lessor actors: passion disguised as truth).Toward the far extreme are actors who put themselves somewhere between a performing instrument and a creator. The simplest of these are that actors who say; `this is me, and this is the character and you know that I know that you know I'm just playing a part...' Usually, these are comedians, brought in to enliven an otherwise dead vehicle.But sometimes we get an actor who has made the very risky choice of always taking that in-between space, the space between the movie and us, and using it to create a dialog quite apart from the story in the movie. Bill Murray - since `Groundhog' - has made this choice, and developed some tools to pull it off.That's why Wes Anderson, and other filmmakers who play with that space (Jarmusch, Coppola) like him so much.That's why he was cast as Polonius in the radical `Hamlet' of 2000.

We don't actually \"get the story,\" instead get some sort of manufactured fiction that glues facts together in appealing ways.But 70 years ago there was a magical confluence of what it meant to make or discover stories, what it meant to \"see,\" and what it meant to be an American. Mixed in there was this notion of an alert woman.Its hard to impress on youngsters beyond a cartoonish awareness that women in society and film were extremely limited in options. Homemaker, secretary, teacher, nurse. Whore. If a woman was intelligent and witty and active, she was a reporter.Seeing and discovering was sexy. Its lost today, that effect. This is post-code; \"Picture Snatcher\" is a better example where the sexiness is darned explicit.Imagine a film that presents a woman far beyond your experience, what you know from real life. Imagine her witty and sexually available outside marriage, at least temporarily so. Smart, full of humor and ready to play severe and grand jokes. Its impossible to do today where Angelina can fight, Tilda can control and Julianne can affect.But just imagine the cinematic power of a newsroom with such juice. The folding, of course with them writing stories and we seeing stories simultaneously. Our admiration of her just as Grant's and both of us conspiring in creating a spectacle around her.(For those who haven't seen it the story is Cary and Joan are lovers  copulation is obvious  and both are star reporters. They decide NOT to marry as not to \"ruin things.\" He advances to control the paper (the story) and she becomes engaged to a book writer. The books in question are vapid \"self-help\" books that lack the vim of \"real\" stories. Grant, drunk and with the help of a gangster pal, conspires to give her firetrucks, policecars, ambulances, even a hearse, all responding to the house where she will wed. That's the present: life.)

So far as the story, the only innovation is humor that is broader and bluer than usual unless you are a \"Meet the Fockers\" type of person.I was interested because of the folding type: Actors playing characters who are acting roles. But that is so common now you can buy templates for your scriptwriting software.Two interesting things. One is mundane: date movies usually show you nothing that doesn't advance the plot. We actually count on this fact: if we know something we expect the characters to know as well. Advancement of the story in this genre includes the necessity that that all is revealed at the end. Whatever we are told, the girl discovers at the end; it is just a matter of her catching up with us.In this case, we are told horrible things about the boyfriend that remain a secret just for the audience. That's unusual and was certainly engineered.The other thing, the thing I actually liked, was the extended preface. We learn that these guys crash weddings, and then for 15 or 20 minutes we attend a dozen or more with them.This sort of dancing and fun usually comes at the end of a date movie. Here it is at the beginning. It is so well assembled that I think they brought in a more professional team just for that. This is so expertly edited that I even surmise that it was done later to help the movie, which is thin story-wise and ordinary in other respects.Possibly some side material about the mother, the oldest daughter (whose wedding introduces the family) and the gay son was removed to make room.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","id":"rw1143236"},{"movie":"We Were Soldiers","heading":"Custard","date":"9 March 2002","content":"Spoilers herein.My dad was a man like this. I saw the film in an audience filled with men and women like this. I've worked with many people like this. The smartest among them know that wars are fought over ideas, and struggle to understand those ideas as intelligent warriors.One understanding is the notion that ideas take on a life of their own and act selfishly to reproduce themselves, adapting as required. One way that ideas battle each other is in films, because films invent society. And so we have the ideas behind this film and the recent `Black Hawk Down,' battling for a subliminal control over how we think of war.And it is a battle royale. Both films use a state of the art visual vocabulary, much advanced since even `Pvt Ryan.' And both films depict an air cavalry mission gone wrong resulting in a stranded, outnumbered group of rangers. Both center the motivation of the men of looking out for the guy next them. Both emphasize the `no man left behind' principle. But `Black Hawk' is a film about situations. Situations create war and the mistakes therein. In that film, the characters are deliberately confusing and there is lots of attention given to spatial definition and position. `Black Hawk' is first a cinematic being with visual sense to which a narrative is applied.`Soldiers' exists in a different world altogether. In this world, men drive events and cause wars. Their commitment (shown here as nobility) is the engine. Personalities matter, even to the point that the killed are listed in the credits. So this film spends lots of time on character development (such as it is) and interactions among (mostly between) them. `Soldiers' was born as a text, to which is here appended illustration.World of difference between these two views, one could say religions. This conflict of ideas is as profound a war as any. And we are the participants, and some of us combatants.You define yourself in large part. And a large part of that is in deciding what you think is funny, another area where movies battle for your soul. That's tough, but at least you can engineer how you approach war movies, and which ones you reach out to.I see that we are polarizing around the old John Wayne issue, with Mel Gibson taking that role.

The purpose of this film is apparently to showcase some skater-related songs. The songs are laconic, moving fluidly but with a dispassionate dullness. That's the affect of skaters today: cool to the point of dull.

In other stupid fantasies, the hero looks at us and winks `look at me make a fool out of all of us, but it's just fun.' Arnie, Mel, they all goof on themselves.But Kostner in real life takes himself so seriously that as an actor he couldn't escape playing it straight. As the mariner, his seriousness here is offputting. Combined with his similar hubris in the industry, this project was doomed.The real interesting story behind this film is the story of how it got so broken at the studio level. After Sony bought Columbia, expecting miracles, another crew of Japanese bought Universal. We've made a special study of this case. The real problem here was the Japanese top-down management style. These guys just got snookered, plus they made some heavy false economies by going outside the film industry for key elements of the marine sets.

Its a mess, visually and rhythmically. There are two things that impressed me though. I thought the \"Rorschach\" character was very successful, in part because he pushed a strong path through the chaos that was both the world of the movie and the movie. He was fully integrated: story, bearing, visuals, including some of the setups. Its baffling to me how everyone else would be so clearly inferior in execution. This idea of having a \"mask\" (which is basically just a headsock) that forms dynamic blots — it is genius.The other thing, dear reader, is something of a personal quirk. I have a fascination with orreries. These are — originally — models of the solar system that were by gears and tracks, novel machinery of different types, supposed to model the movement of at least the planets. As an student of modeling and abstraction, these have a historical significance for me, and I find that they have become a sort of minor but very strong icon in film.Here we have one, a modern type. It is almost a perfect blend of Superman's crystal fort in the first movie, and the \"device\" in \"Contact.\" We are supposed to believe that this is the perfect creation of a perfect mind, one that can see everything in how it works and can model it in such a way that it controls those forces. It is, thus, a model of himself, everything he knows and his transit and container. There is a plot point where the lover's emotions destroy is by simply existing, but that is another story.I loved the design of the thing; its just marvelous.

In the world of movies, those consequences can be profound.Take Spielberg, a moderately talented filmmaker who eschews originality and insight, instead trusts an extraordinary intuition about what people like. Or think they like. Or can be fooled into liking with a several hundred million dollar promotion budget.This is part of that promotion, a fake documentary about science fiction movies with a commercial for Spielberg's \"War of the Worlds,\" tacked on a the end. The \"history\" here is his own version of what happened in the genre, which naturally enough starts when he started watching movies.So we get a story about science fiction movies from an accomplished storyteller with a selfish purpose. And it is nearly all wrong. I hope this is enough to warn you away from this travesty. It is bad enough that he peppers us with vulgar movies (yes, even the nobly themed \"Schindler\"); but it is beyond the pale for him to reinvent the history of cinema to suit himself.Science fiction goes all the way back to the invention of movies (and of course before that in literature). The core notion has always been with us: we enter the world of film to see another world. So far as films about the future and/or space, that element of the genre was fully mature by the end of the 30s and reached its peak in \"Forbidden Planet\" of 1956.After that, the genre was reimagined to host technological thrills either in the story or in the effects brazenly displayed. Scott (shown here with the briefest of comments) added horror with \"Alien\" and improved on the self-reference of \"Planet\" with \"Bladerunner.\" All this without the meddling of Mr Dreamworks. Bah.Incidentally,Spielberg's one really good film (\"Close Encounters\") is a French New Wave project about movie-making only wrapped in sci-fi like the French (and now the Hong Kongers) like to wrap in the gangster genre.

Reading him feels like swimming through interesting bodies tightly packed in pomegranate flavored honey, desiccated down to smudges on a page, then reconstituted by the eye through memories of that sweet fluid. Like that.It was he who refined the notion of internal, contradictory dialog and sometime untrusted narrative. He's important to what we have in film.I thought of him recently as I am in a patch of good movies. I saw a Louis Malle film last night and the style reminded me of James: economical ambiguity. Clean, but open. And the night before that I saw a film of a novel by George Eliot and I recalled what James said of Elliot  that she had a horrible face, but he fell in love with her  this from a man who never married and whose ability to love is questioned. Reminded me of Catherine from this story.So I sought this out and was surprised to find Jennifer Leigh. She's a sort of female Johnny Depp. Though she is accused of being overlarge in her characterizations, I find her engaging in pretty much every project. This business of exaggeration to be real is tricky business, and excess works in many cases. Visceral commitment trumps delicate reality, because reality IS commitment.Here's the problem: this is a complex book, a braid of four galaxies of urges collected in four beings and squared off against each other. The contrivance is only in the setup: the tragic wheels turn ultra-realistically.The film does not, cannot, reflect this with anywhere near the internal view of the novel. But I liked it. One cinematic trick that used is that nearly every scene has something in the background. It may be an obtrusive object, but is as likely to be a secondary character with some non-secondary trait. Or some activity you see in the back and can't ignore even though the continuity of the narrative is in the foreground.And that foreground is embodied in four quite talented actors, each with a fundamentally different acting style. These actors were selected because their styles contrast with that of the characters. Leigh for instance is one of the most visibly confident actors alive, while Finney who plays the overbearing father, has a style based on obvious fear of being.It isn't quite James.

It isn't something that makes sense at all, and seems to be — if it is not completely random — the product of a clever mind. The genre was created by Hollywood and then adopted in the third generation by Besson who with great care did to it what Leone did to the western. Its is an anti-ironic twist, taking the ironic, self-mocking attitude from Hollywood and mapping it to something the filmmaker takes quite seriously.

Two lawmen in town. A pair of men -- the focus of the story -- are in the midst of every one of these couplings. While each small brick of the story is based on these simple tensions, they are put together in a complex fabric.The fabric is one that is tied up with an introspective device. Its all about stories, who told who what, who is controlling what story and how that control is tragically lost.The town is controlled not by violence, but stories of control. Encounters -- here they are called \"calling out\" -- are because someone was told a false story which wants to be promulgated.

First we had the book, which has excellent energy: mechanical beasts as languid swans among us. Consummate language of inevitability.Then we had Orson Welles on Wells; the radio drama that blurred the definition of sight. Yes, this is about sight and always has been. The 1953 version acknowledged this and took out all the religious stuff and replaced it with things whose sight is lethal. And what things those eyes were! Designed on Mars to emulate beaux art wrapping of what in the fifties was considered the ultimate in high tech vision: the three dots of color TeeVee. The saucers in this case were floating on legs of electricity and exterminated gracefully.Sure, it was essentially a chase movie, but a chase of an eye following poor souls. What could be more cinematic? On the heels of this our genius in Hollywood decides to take the same material and scrub all the cinematic value out of it. Sure, he could have approached it with the same intelligence as \"Close Encounters,\" which was a French New Wave film about the creative discovery of imagination. It was essentially a movie about movies.Perhaps he didn't know. Perhaps he just didn't have time: this was pushed up two years ahead of schedule. Perhaps he just didn't care, since all his efforts at intelligent and meaningful film-making just blend into his more mundane commercial successes.But he does know how to stage a scene that manages motion: the orchestrated motion of camera, foreground and often opposing motion in the background. He doesn't do well in three dimensions and you can see every static storyboard along the way. But when he's good at vision, he's good.Plus. Plus this gives the opportunity of the extra motion of the swans, which is how Wells described the ships.But no dance here, no cinematic composition. And no languid ships. These are a cross between the monsters of \"Wild Wild West\" and \"Star Wars.\" At least those were apt. These ships clunk and grind. They destroy and collect. Their eyes and weapons are different from each other. Instead of being otherworldly, they seem distinctly human, as if they were designed by Lex Luthor.Okay, so the story changes focus from being about invaders to being about Tom and kids. Even Mel Gibson in his basement was more engaging, and that's pretty damning.One final insult. This starts the same as the 1953 movie, with a narrator giving background.

I hate how it has changed news into the most trivial of snips, how it it has transformed politics into the manipulation of narrative, and how it has made it commonplace for advertisers to assault our deepest senses. But most of all, I curse it for the way it drags on film, real film. The very existence of TeeVee means that we are trained differently than we might allow ourselves to be. But when we have a \"major\" film event and it uses TeeVee conventions, its particularly repellent.Pop music is what it is because of the accident of how the market has evolved to make money from it. You have to buy an artifact to \"own\" the music. At least that used to be the case, and even today that model is still clung to by the \"music business.\" Because the idea is not to provide music, but to sell artifacts, the music is perturbed. It has developed into a form that suits the market: so many seconds, so few hooks, so much personal charisma or charm. The result is that what we carry in our heads as melodies are little sales viruses that crowd out the transformative power of real music.TeeVee is worse, because it digs semantically deeper.The commercial compact with theatrical film is rather straightforward: if something is attractive enough, I will pay. Then I will enter a space designed to eliminate everything but the film. I will engage in a shared world with the filmmaker. During that uninterrupted time, we engage in the long form, something unique, something special, something powerful enough to change lives. I decide what is attractive, what tradeoffs I wish to make and to some extent when.TeeVee is a different contract. They're interested in attracting me not so I can see the primary narrative, but all sorts of inserted side narrative designed to convince me to buy something. The purpose is not to be whole, singly engaged. In fact it is the opposite, to be serially interrupted. So TeeVee never engages in the long form proper. Instead it builds on small episodes. It gives the illusion of the long form by stringing episodes together and having some large container. That large container in the original soap opera are grand sweeps of human interaction: betrayal, scheming, justice. In this case, that is enhanced by large sweeps of war that surround this, provide some notion of flow, and even plot devices that allow tragedy and separation. But its still a soap opera. Its still chunks, little chinks to go between ads and slightly larger chunks to be consumed in an evening. Oh, you may get involved in various characters, but you'll more likely be involved in the accounting process, simply keeping track of who that was that now reappears, and what story they are re-igniting for a little flash before jumping to the next.If you are like me, you use film as a tool for life; you use narrative and explorations of it as part of a rich adventure with people who can make stories that weave with selves. Its a gift, the biggest we have as humans. If so, if you feel this way. If you depend on art. Then you will be disgusted by the TeeVee travesties of the long form that are shaped only by the crassest of market forces.This is the first \"big\" miniseries production, and it is a template for many others that followed. Its probably no worse than many others, but it should be reviled because it was the first.

We come to expect this, and I believe have rather clear thresholds about what works. I think when you try to these ambitious story arcs, you have to pay attention to these thresholds. For all its faults, the \"Matrix\" films impose style on a robust enough narrative. You have to have a narrative.Here, we have a story line: young nerd with hidden powers revenges his father, only to discover deceit, then he takes revenge on the deceivers. That could have worked, if it had been supported. It has before, right? There's all sorts of meta-noir possibility here: the ordinary man picked out and placed in a situation long since determined. The idea of death being visited on people, directed from supernatural sources by seemingly supernatural agents. The idea of fate weaving in lives and so on. The cinematic ideas of a man whose vision \"slows things down,\" and as narrator for us in voice and sight.But its all given short shrift here. We cannot rely on this narrative to carry us. Hitchock's wife was in charge of vetting scripts for this property of robustness and I believe that the threshold of what can accept in speculative noir was discovered or defined by her. This fails. Which basically leaves us with some very energetic and brutal stylizations within which we can encounter Angeline. I suppose that because of these roles, she is the most bankable actress in the world. I do think she knows how to do this. In \"Smith\" she drove the story simply with her attitude. In Tomb Raider 1, I think she successfully defined this persona, a confident sexual being who could match any male film presence. That's what this is all about.She actually does support that well enough in the early chase scene where its her movie. But then we have to start relying on the narrative to move us along, and we get stuck with Morgan Freeman's silliness. She simply becomes a watcher with nothing to do. She cannot carry it off because there's nothing to fill, no movement to get behind.And so much of it fights itself. There's a hint of a sexual relationship, but its random. There's a \"training\" session that makes no sense at all and seemingly is inserted only to film brutality. There's much made of curved bullet paths. Is this a supernatural talent, or special bullet designs, or something to do with spin while shooting?But, you know, I could have tolerated the whole thing, all the rats, the predictability, the incoherence.

He creates a cinematic tone. Into that tone is spun a place and his actors are expected to find their way within it. Only then do we see characters, and the camera is never, ever glued to personalities.It is a world of difference, as different as people who can talk only about other people contrasted to those who can create another world in a conversation.Sooner or later, all lucid watchers must make a choice about how big their film universe can be.

This is remarkably blunt as those rats that Scorsese put at the end of his \"Departed.\" The other is the really annoying and repeated way he combines buildings and quantitative displays.

A great many films are incompetent, so I have my own private parade when I run across one that has a coherent vision and the skill or artistry to make that vision real. This is such. At the end of my parade starts the encounter group I have with my different selves over whether to accept that vision, to enter and inhabit that world.Many of my selves are attracted to Roeg's world. This is a film about the problems of film, about peering into a different world using pure vision. Good. And he uses an all- too-common mode for representing such engagement: sexual attraction. Self-awareness as sexual awareness, and that self-awareness of the character folded into the self- awareness of the viewer and his/her position as distant.Parts of me point out the novel slant on this: interesting plots that are artificially twisted around this notion of separate worlds peering at each other. Other parts celebrate the amazing efficiency and richness of the visual grammar.Where I have problems is the reduction of the grand universe of engagement to the limited playground of sexual obsession. Here and in \"Man Who Fell\" we have this conceit. When I saw this in 71, I thought it was a cool conflation, because I was part of a whole social movement that made the same mapping. Thirty years later that seems thin, even dangerously, addictively sophomoric. You, dear viewer, may not have the same legacy and need to so aggressively reject this mapping.

Nothing new at all here and the history changed to fit the formula. At another level  the one most moviegoers will see  is a concert with background intended to make the concert richer. If you had ever seen John and June perform, you will know that this movie version is a whole lot better. And you may also admit that the reason you went to see them wasn't because of their music, but because of the whole story of them and what they symbolized -- and how that colored the music.In other words, their lives were deliberately part of the show. They made it so, even punching up John's ex-con status and other tough guy attributes. The whole Carter family developed this as a marketing strategy long before John appeared, though their lives were artificially made in the mold of wholesome, white Baptists.So, if you follow these things, what we have here is a nice construction: Two stage performers who make their lives part of their performance, portrayed in another performance (the movie) that features the reverse: lives illustrated through stage performances. Managing all those layers as they have makes this mildly interesting.And the surprise of Reese is something too, though it makes sense if you know the type that southern women played as roles in those days.What's missing is all the interesting stuff. John's obsession with the devil, the theories of his brother being murdered or committing suicide, the long-term weaving of paths with Bob Dylan  holy and otherwise. The debauchery. The deliberate manipulation of religion in the 70s as part of the public relations of his comeback. His phenomenal loss of weight. The rivalry among his touring mates. Deep, deep, rivalry.Now wouldn't all that real stuff have made a better movie than the formula script we have here?As with all big movies these days, you have the movie proper and you have the beginning sequence.

Where being was more about ideas, ideals and intents than tribal exclusionism. One of these was the late sixties. If you were there in the midst of it, you would have experienced something that simply cannot be described today  a sort of group mind that was so shared and shared with better futures that is was often mistaken for spiritual. Much of that reflected and was fed by the music of the time. Folk. Rock, and that quantum edge between that often seemed perfect. So you, dear reader, may have to simply accept on trust that the music of the times, and times themselves, mattered. That's even though the artifacts have been since re-incarnated as ordinary things.Much of that ordinariness has been because of how we have reinvented the story to allow ourselves to handle the disappointment of the futures we ended up with. And a large part of that reinvention has been through movies that retell and reshape.Much of that can be laid at the feet of the slick marketeers behind what has become known as \"country\" music, where the story is in the surrounding wrapper of a metastory: honesty, forthrightness, god and country, guns. (This package comes with the standard negatives: anti-gay, woman, minority, etc.)The unwitting patron saint of this particular reinvention was Johnny Cash, a poor soul swept up in his and our addictions until even after death. That's when we got a particularly revolting biography. We seemed to want it. It has true love, a successful struggle with demons, performances of music to fill in for the thin story. Grimaces and joy.It also trivialized what the music of the era was. It turned a whole social movement into a mere plot device, no different than say a Denzel Washington-coached football championship. The music didn't matter at all. It was the fame that turned lives. (Something similar happened with \"A Beautiful Mind\" where the mathematics was incidental instead of what made the man mad, and along the way changes imagination in and of us all. But few people believe in math, and nearly everyone considers power in music as heavy.)Oddly, our reaction to this trivialization is not to look deeper at the real thing, but to add a third layer of abstraction that further trivializes. I must admit to laughing here and there, especially at the Dylan spoof. But I left the theater wondering if this is all we end up with from this era. Is it merely a joke now? Is this yearning and work already the same level as the fodder for \"Austin Powers?\"Kids used to play with toy cars. They weren't real cars, but the play was generally along the lines of what real cars do, sometimes flying, but not as planes  only cars on air-roads. Then at some point, the cars could transform into robots and the robots themselves conveyed a simple cosmology of good and evil. Play became disembodied, and the connection with reality was lost.This is a transformer movie: three layers removed, transforming what celebrated complexity, subtlety and ambiguity into something manufactured by promoters as a battle of good and evil, and then transformed into a joke.Tom Paine dies again.

Why I spend so much time with stuff that doesn't seem important. Here's one reason why. Sometimes an apparently offhand movie, made for simple consumption will surprise you.This is being celebrated as a quirky little comedy with serious overtones. According to the expected date formula, it ends happily. But that's not what I saw. I saw a serious work, by a serious young artist that I would like to see more of. I saw Hartley's influence without knowing the background. If you don't know Hartley, he's a Canadian filmmaker that makes small films. They are called quirky by mainstream movie reviewers. What else are they to say? Its a catchall notion that signifies something that works by using unconventional means but the reviewer cannot say why.Hartley's films are highly abstract. They are often called stylized, but that usually applies to theatrical conventions. Hartley abstracts in a different dimension of his own. Its abstraction, not simplification. And it usually works because he gets actors that know how to collaborate in it well. One of these was Adrianne Shelly. A redhead.She took that level and type of abstraction and did something Hartley couldn't do: she folded her own life into the thing. The story is about her, her marriage and pregnancy. It was written while she was pregnant and at the end features her own daughter as the result of that pregnancy. She writes, directs and acts, but the role she has chosen is not the central one. The narrative stance is as the observer. All the abstraction is done on the observer side.Its amazingly effective and consistent.One device that works rather well is how her own approach to the film deviates from the norm. (The norm here is set in the first few minutes as a date movie.) She folds that into how her character deviates from the norm in designing and making pies. The diner is conflated into a theater, with poetry seductions, affairs, a wedding.Its where we see the small, important and original work of Hartley blossom.(The filmmaker was murdered before seeing the film in theaters.)See this.

(Jees)I did enjoy it. Its an amazing experience. But while watching it, I also was admiring the minds behind it. There are sometimes intelligent movies being made, and a surprising number of them are from Hollywood. I believe though that in most cases, it is because there is a critical mass of intelligent writers, filmmakers and decisionmakers that are working at the fringe of the establishment. Not so with Pixar. I've been constantly surprised at each project how they encapsulate essays in the advance of the cinematic vocabulary.Its a bit like French new wave films made by film theorists, the films being more about what can be done than doing it in the service of effect that matters. (Their retort would be that it DOES matter if it changes the vehicle.)But this Pixar business is a different model. Folks can come and be entertained without having to dip into vats of self-reference. Oh, there's plenty of superficial self-reference, but its all in the service of jokes, and they are all in the service of the narrative.But other folks  like me and perhaps you  can also see that they are doing a few things that no one else is in quite the same advanced way, and they mark them so that you can read it as a sort of metanarrative. Jobs does the same thing with Apple. They make products that people use and like. But they also are in the business of defining what it is to be cool. They manufacture cool like they manufacture electronic products. You get both, and even in the products there's a reference to leadership, because being cool is all in who defines cool.So when I saw this, I saw self-conscious art, and stories about the future of cinema. We've always gotten that with Pixar. Usually, it has to do with space, and what you can do with this new medium that is impossible with \"real\" cameras and places.This last movie, \"Ratatouie\" added in the notion of control. Pulling the strings. I'm sure many have noticed that the shorts that Pixar creates to play before these features are a sort of synopsis of the reflective ideas they will use in the film. Last time the short and film were about control at a distance, with both the puppetmaster and puppet being featured, but the star was the puppetmaster. You can almost see how the whole story could have been generated by this idea: chef, French (who claim to have invented folded cinema of the reflexive kind), and rat. Secret recipes. Love always.This time around, the cinematic sensibilities are profoundly deeper. A deep certainty. You have to know about 2001 as a start. Kubric's interest there was the warring narrator. Whose world is telling the story, man, machine or god. There is a story, but it hardly matters. Its all about who is telling the story, whose chair you sit in as the viewer. Its a masterful work.Here, its bent only a little: mankind, machine and nature, but its folded back on the story  which here has effect. Wall-e is natural, machine in form, but more human than the humans we see. But watch how they fold it again. Its a movie about the truth in movies, how the power of cinema can reach into the real world. A handholding there and here is a handhold between the worlds. And also watch how they built movies in. This isn't accidental. When they put a movie within a movie like this, the intent is to have the watcher of the outer movie join the world of the watcher of the inner movie. Its a reliable trick to get us to invest in what we see. But they go further. When we see the humans  who are supposed to be like us but clearly aren't  we note that THEY are hypnotized by the movies in front of them and cannot see the larger world beyond, and we can.It happens to also spill over into the great narrative about how some of us can see that the planet is being destroyed and other blithely putter on. That business about saving image- laden artifacts as a memory storehouse... All these layers  yes they are engineered by what is now the most intelligent and adventuresome narrative engineering lab in a studio.All this extra introspection is used not as dry thesis, but in the service of the love story.

I believe that all of Stone's projects are autobiographical and he impresses on them his own story. Its Woody Allen, except instead of placing himself in the cosmic forces of personal relationships and self, he wanders among what he sees is a cosmos of global conspiracy. That he is able to make a living in Hollywood is, I think, because our notions of noir are close enough to this so that he (and Spike Lee) can bloviate and make a living.As time goes on, he worries more and more about himself, so he makes his heroes basically good men, lost. But this time history bucks him. The culpability of this man cannot be explained away by blaming Rove and Cheney. His qualms about torture are known to not have happened.

But surely it had as profound an effect on daily lives.To understand this film, you need to know some history. Alas, many readers will not appreciate the cold war that was the overriding impetus for the two largest political entities from the 50s through the 80s.Some dates for you. In 56, the US saw \"Forbidden Planet,\" with a superintelligent robot, space travel and mind augmentation. It was based on Shakespeare's most interesting play and is still among the best scifi films. In 57, Russia launched a satellite and declared that they \"owned\" space (and would put nuclear bombs over the US ready to \"drop\"). Also, that soon, they would have men in space.In 58 one of the most successful Russian filmmakers (Klushantsev) made a film about \"cosmonauts\" and space travel that was enormously successful with the Russian public (and their captive peoples). That film was the beginning of a deeper than usual partnership between Klushantsev and the propaganda arm of the Kremlin.In 1960, an unknown in East Germany made a film (Road to the Stars) about cosmonauts on Venus. It was a runaway hit. In the following year, Kennedy made his famous pledge to put an American on the moon by the end of the decade. The Soviet moon program had some catastrophic disasters, in large part resulting from lies told to the old Stalin regime by Soviet scientists working on ballistic missiles supposedly (but not really) capable of destroying the US. Khrushchev had these scientists destroyed or imprisoned. That meant no moon program.But the people already were convinced that Venus was the prize, so the space propagandists seized on this and retooled their manned program as a race to Venus, forget the moon. As a consequence, Klushantsev was given a (for the times and conditions) vast budget and told to make a film of the heroic Soviet nation exploring Venus. This he did in the 62 \"Planet of Tempests,\" known in the US as \"Planet of Storms.\"The effects developed by this team would be used in strange circumstances for the next 8 years. This crew filmed fake footage of real spaceflights. The Kremlin was never so bold as to fake a success when everyone knew the missions ended in fiery death. But they did decorate their successes with these true-fake movies. The most famous was the 65 spacewalk of Leonov, wonderfully believable until you wonder who is holding the camera. Oddly, the propagandists assumed that the camera eye was such a magical omnipresence that no one would ask.Anyway, that 62 film was somehow procured by the infamous Roger Corman. He shortened it and dubbed in English. He substituted the blank female (who says in an orbital craft) with an even more blank female. One wonders why; Faith Domergue had been hot 15 years earlier but here is wallpaper. And he adds an earthside leader who radios a few times, played by the already embarrassing Basil Rathbone. Something interesting could be said about his Sherlock Holmes here.Kubrick's 1968 2001, used many conventions from this shop, even when they went against the science of the thing. And ever since, on through \"Star Wars,\" we have that single vision of what space SHOULD look like.Anyway, when you see this, you are seeing all these layers.

Also how he makes faces signify. But there are other things that are special to me:  how on the edges he merges the film we see with films (or TeeVee) within so we have an unobtrusive reminder of the introspection the humor suggests but cannot reify. how multiple narratives overlap in layered ways, so that multiple agency is overt. Its the exact opposite of noir, and a subtle but welcome invitation to an open life. Usually, there's an element of expression in these narratives: in \"Speak\" it was speaking, dancing, watching, having lucid sex, bullfighting, writing... how women's lives balance between that edge of noir and the world of magical impulse we who watch are given to live in.

Its not trivial, the problem of what does space mean in films? What narrative role does it play? What vocabulary is relevant?This film is rather mundane in most ways. It is a biography of a fellow of influence. He's quirky, but always in a desirable way (so far as the entertained audience). His profession — why he is important — allows for all sorts of images, from interviews, filming of him now and in the past, silly animations, and shots of the buildings he has photographed. As a biography and film, it is something of a yawn, as ordinary as they claim the fellow to be extraordinary. But it gives an excuse to think deeply about architecture and image, about motion, space and narrative.The context: starting in the 30s in Europe a general philosophical trend toward purity was reflected in schools of architecture. The main notion there was the use of modern materials to escape traditional constraints in form. This would allow a designer to use forms that were pure, natural, deep. Differences among groups were a matter of what path was best in finding purity, nature and depth. It was a good time. Out of that general influence stepped some designers in Los Angeles who appropriated some principles of purity from one of these schools. Planes, power, open glass, but in an architecturally superficial way. What they did instead was separate these notions of European architecture from the narrative of real explorations into being and self into a narrative of wealth and a privileged lifestyle.Architectural effects were neutered in the service of selling this \"California Lifestyle\" and reduced to powerful planes that pushed past invisible glass walls. Purity became \"a good view.\" Rethinking of space became simple openness. What began as a matter of meaning, turned into a matter of advertising a narrative, something of an artificial one. Sure, some of the effects in these buildings were competent, but they were largely in the same business as the television executives who bought the houses. It was a bad time.Now, along comes a talented photographer, or rather one who would become talented and who would make this architecture famous. Why is illustrative.His talent is the ability to make a narrative out of certain views of these accommodating structures. Or, if you please, he finds the narrative. This film is wonderful in that when you actually see him work (he still does) you can see him aligning forms so that from front to back — always in a one point perspective — there is an articulated flow that indicates energy. Many times, he uses that energy to indicate a connection with the environment. It is a masterly art, a good thing. I did not appreciate the influence this fellow has had on cinematographers, and how they handle architecture. You need the bold planes and deep spaces of \"modern\" architecture for this relatively simple technique, but you can clearly see it in, say Sasha Vierny, or XX.As to the value of the film as a film, it is far less competent than the things is speaks of, and draws on witnesses who are not worth listening to.

When we do, we should take advantage of it.My own feeling about films is that the actor is the last person to trust to understand the project. An actor has his own concerns, and some of those conflict with those of the filmmaker. It is the filmmaker's job to create the vision. So too with cinematographers. Whenever one of them wrests control of a film, the film is lessened from what it might have been.That's because film is a uniquely multidimensional experience. Take film music. This is is an art all to itself. Hearing film composers chat about their work is interesting, and that is the level of what we get here. But hearing a talented critic of film music talk about many composers and techniques and effects is a real treat. We missed that here, even before we get into some incredible examples that were overlooked, because because of politics, perhaps because they were too sophisticated for target TeeVee audience, perhaps because the requisite talking head was unavailable.But on beyond that, how wonderful would it have been to have someone intelligent use even these same examples and speak from the perspective of filmmaker. That guide would let us know the negatives of the craft (sorry, couldn't resist), how effects can be composed across skills (art design, editing, acting, writing). It would be worthwhile. To listen to these guys, a film starts with a story, everyone supports the story as best they can, and of these the photographer brings it to life, perhaps artfully.

I think he did this with New York before he realized it. Now, even though it is clearly uncomfortable, he is traveling the world looking for other places.Unfortunately, there are few places on the planet that are as visually keyed to emotions as Manhattan. London. Barcelona.I'm really pleased to see him still pushing himself, still placing himself outside his previous success. Here, he works with a person as place. It's a challenging cinematic experiment.-- he merges this experiment with another that he and others have mastered: a single character appearing in three personalities. He only does two at a time in all three combinations. And again it is autobiographical. All Woody is.His three types of women who collectively compose his complex character here are played by Scarlett with whom he clearly has a quiet sexual passion. Here she is adventuresome enough to enter his cinematically composed she-being as essentially sexual being. Her occupation is continuously improving photography which (with painting) Woody and others often conflate with film-making.His second woman is too predictable to describe. Woody has entered Almodovar territory, physically, sexually and emotionally. Cruz merely has to show up in her passionate Almadovar kit. She's an emotional basketcase, a sexual genius, a painter.The third woman is the new bit in this equation. She's the most attractive, the most self aware. Where the film is sets about watching the exploration of selves in place, she is a student of that place. She is the one who sees and fears and yet indulges. She is the true love, or rather her existence is what makes love possible.Her occupation is the \"study\" of Catalon culture.The radical observation here is that she leaves the place, this empowering it.-- and of course the third grand element is not that this is Barcelona, but Gaudi's Barcelona. The place is only accidentally a physical place. It's really a spatial philosophy that suits (and indeed invented) the notion of superimposed ambiguous sexual emotions on space.We are, for all the womanly registration scenes, in Gaudi spaces, either physically or by reference. Energies from the soul recorded, enticed and charmed from the forms we see in two dimensions.If Woody ever were to do a three D movie, this would be the one. Alas, he passes. And he omits the most complex and life- changing place, the crypt of the unfinished chapel. Shame on his advisers.This is essential Tedg stuff. Introspection.

I think the idea is terrific and the execution wobbly at least by today's standards.First, the story, which is clever and self-referentially about the making of itself.Initially, we are shown the female lead's eye and told that there are spirals within spirals concerning that eye.Then we have a prolog that tells us that the person you expect to fall isn't the one that does, and that the overriding driver here is guilt.Act 1 starts with a `Thin Man' type bantering couple as a blind. But the detective format is by steps perturbed. It quickly happens that our detective falls in love with a clearly deranged married woman who kills herself by jumping off a tower.Act 2: wracked with private and public guilt, our detective is beaten. He is literally put into the looneybin. After a year, he discovers a girl similar to his beloved. Completely obsessed, he becomes `filmmaker' and casts her in the role of his unforgettable love. At the end of Act 2, we discover that she really was his lost love and was acting then. Now she has to act as if she never acted, while playing the role he `writes.'Act 3 has the focus on her balancing the reality of one created self with that of another created self, and interacting with our hapless detective who is part creator, part witting viewer and part unwitting viewer in the play.The denouement comes with his realization of part (but not all) of her act and her (accidental?) fall from the same tower and the forthcoming guilt that implies.The `detective' as both discoverer and director and at last writer.This is an incredibly rich construction, especially considering the period and the restrictions of the studio system. It has lots of folds for our actress to play one of her several personae off others and for the `detective' viewer/creator to be baffled by moving among layers of creation and reference. Lots of opportunities to have the `acting' be movie-like, for instance in Judy's first appearance as Madeleine but pretending not to be Madeleine, where Hitchcock has her emerge stalking from a green fog.But now to the actual realization as a film. The reason we love Hitchcock is because he invented the notion of a camera eye that moved with curiosity, and he was able to use this as a central element in the narrative. It isn't exactly a new visual grammar but it was revolutionary then and common practice today. But that revolution isn't employed in the service of this wonderful narrative. What we have are just two remarkable shots, neither anything like the `goodbye Babs' shot in `Frenzy.' The first is the explanation of the murder: we have to be impressed by the economy by which we are told how the murder was done. Only a couple seconds of images.The other image is the first appearance of Madeleine in Eddie's Restaurant. This is such a rich construction that Peter Greenaway was to expand it into an entire film all by itself, complete with `green' and `red' worlds, `The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover.' It deals with just this same shifting in and out of actor and role denoted by kitchen and dining room.There are a few other competent shots too, but nothing of the brilliance of eye and narrative we saw in `Rear Window.' In fact, the production is rather poor once one gets past the colors, interiors and costumes. The key problem is that a narrative this complexly folded needs real actors. And not just ordinarily good like Tony Hopkins, but that rare kind who can present several dimensions at once, like Sean Penn and Julianne Moore. What we have here are pretty slim talents made worse by working for a guy that demands `just stand here and say these words the way I tell you to say them.'\nEven played without all the dimensions (which is to say `old style,' before Brando), Stewart can only go as far as befuddlement. Novak is decidedly a lesser talent whose only qualification so far as Hitchcock is concerned is her one look. By today's standards, those horsey eyebrows look ridiculous.And so does all the cheesy backprojection. Watch this because Hitchcock was an intelligent film mind and he had an amazing idea.

Film can also thrill -- without much effort on the part of the viewer -- more than any other medium. Any other art can exceed it (TeeVee is not included in this) but only by dint of effort.This tradition of summer films whose only purpose is to thrill is a strange phenomenon. Incidentally, it must put strange pressures on the filmmakers who want to surf that ever more lucrative wave. Thrill films are basically pornographic: the story exists as the barest excuse to cobble together the `good parts.' Acting/reading is incidental. What matters is pace and intensity.But sex pornography is pretty much always the same thing, and thrill porn must always top the previous standard. Nonetheless, there are only so many things to work with: fights, car chases, explosions, elaborate spaceships, monsters,Egypt, outerspace, underwater are problematic because these types of film depend on familiarity: for instance an exploding space ship now has to look a certain way, quite contrary to reality, or it doesn't look real. Car wrecks must always flip and fly or explode or we don't believe it. You can press humor only so far, as Renny Harlin discovered in `Cutthroat Island.'Renny himself discovered the possibilities of mountain adventure with `Cliffhanger.' Its novelty alone brought success, in spite of cheesy effects and the burden of Sly. Now `Vertical' dips into the same pile, but with much better effect technology and more investment in a story of sorts. It is the same rescue bit, but with two side plots: the kid who sacrificed his dad to save his sister -- the climbing ace whose wife was killed by a climber to save that climber's life -- the confluence of those at the end when the ace kills the bad guy climber in identical circumstances, validating the son's decision (and incidentally again saving the sister).There's some art in all these plotline symmetries, even to the presaging in the opening: 2 unrelated climbers disrupting a trio, and I appreciate this.The effects are rather good as effect movies go: that opening sequence may become classic. But the pacing is dull and repetitive, outcomes and images predictable. One problem is that everyone is wrapped up in cold clothes, so much of range of the actors is off the table. Which is a problem because the director really wants the actors to add dramatic tension to the mix. Alas this group would be unable to do that in the best of circumstances.The heaviest burden of this film is the existence of the IMAX film on Everest.

These were marketed to couples where the woman felt uncomfortable with the hard core stuff that was then exploding as a market. Laura Gemser starred in many of these. She is a very pretty Indonesian girl, in her mid- twenties here. The fold is that she is a photographer, and we play up the photographs of the location, merged with voyeurism.

Though only the translation is by Stoppard, this is the most Stoppardian of notions: to amuse us with a story about people just as greedy as ourselves for luxurious entertainment -- and to please while condemning.The story goes farther into the truth: all entertainers are slaves, prostitutes. The game for an artist is one of drawing lines between that slavery and the noble joys of creation. Vatel does what he does because his obnoxious sponsors provide him the means to do what he desires.

It is how I build my life.They are work. Art is work if you intend to collect and use it as fuel. So when you refine your notions about which films are worth the effort, you implicitly also make decisions. There are the films that aren't worth the precious time you have left, of course. But along the way you also find those films and filmmakers you can relax with. Instead of putting your whole soul on the line, you can just find a groove and relax.I only knew this filmmaker from 'The Man with No Past,' and that had a little too much bitter in the bittersweet. This is apparently his first film in that form. It isn't something he invented, but because he is Finnish, it may be the most effective distillation of it.There are two characteristics. One is the very careful flattening into two cinematic worlds. One is very straightforward: things are as they seem. People are no more than what you encounter: their inner selves are worn on their faces. You see all the way to the bottom. The encounters are simple, here we have simple friendship: two guys meet in jail. They are friends before the first one even wakes up to an offered cigarette. (There is more smoking in this film than I think I have ever seen.) There is the simplest reduction of romance, or rather the cinematic romance of the date movie. This always runs the risk of being cartoonish, or cloying, or even just boring, no matter how genuine. The second world is one of cinematic dreams, of what you really dream when you awake and think it was of love. It is highly economical, and deeply symbolic. A best friend of 25 years dies suddenly, someone we have invested in, someone with plans that will have formed the basis of the movie to come, we expect. Ten seconds and he is gone. As soon as we get the minimum information, almost as sparse as a Rockwell painting, we have a shot of a black dog running away under a garbage-strewn elevated road. That also is only a few seconds, but it gives us the shadows, the dream foundation, and is so richly evocative we instantly collaborate by filling in what we know from our dreams, the fears, sadness, disorder of death.In most filmmakers, this second world is shoved in your face and delivers humor, or perhaps some delivered allegory. And that is where the power of detachment comes in. Nordic people are famously flat emotionally, but among them, Finns are extreme. And is seems that among Finns, Kaurismäki is extreme. Both of these layers are presented in an Anti-Hitchcock fashion. The camera has no identity, makes no judgement, has no dreams.Both worlds are delivered with no emotional content and an absolute minimum of structure. All you do is pour in your own, which you can do, but only because there is a shadow layer that affirms dreams. I am tempted to say that the love story is the same, folding the foreground of the garbage collector and the dreams he has as the woman he falls in love with as instantly and effortlessly as every other raindrop in this film.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw2531174"},{"movie":"Vanya on 42nd Street","heading":"Four Layers","date":"30 August 2000","content":"There's no shortage of intelligent work in film. But here we have one of the most complexly referential things I've ever seen. Simple self-reference points to itself. Common self-reference points to the viewer defining the experience.But Mingus used to say why have three threads when you can have seven? Here, some of the most adventurous thinkers in film give us four threads, actually four and a half.We have the Chekhov play and the Mamet wrapping. Make no mistake that this is not an editing or a translation, but an annotation. We have two perspectives simultaneously. Add to that the notion of the play not as a play for an audience as intended, but an event conducted regularly by the performers for their own sake. This is a creation orchestrated by Gregory, the third thread. One can clearly see in some scenes neither Chekhov nor Mamet but artists collaborating in dialogs. The inner eyes and the outer eyes differ.Fourth, we have Malle's creation which introduces us into the equation with deliberately shaky and sometimes misframed camerawork. We aren't part of any prior experience, but the actors do include the camera in their collaboration, as an independent thread. Watch how Andre works the camera.And finally, we have the framing of the artists in real life. This is not simultaneous with the others and in any case excludes the filmmaker.I recall seeing Paul Newman in the Color of Money in the first scene, acting on three levels simultaneously. It took my breath away. Here, the purpose of the whole contrivance is to challenge the actors (and the viewers!) to participate in a jazz ensemble of acting where the layer of reality is constantly shifting. They chose Uncle Vanya as the base for a reason, because his evershifting foci of love and hate in pairs provide cues for levelshifting. Shawn really plays on this. His skill wasn't apparent to me on first viewing, especially in the first scenes, where all players are on stage and the non-focus actors have to be invisible. But on repeated viewings one can see his mastery, his shifting forehead! Maybe he could have been a Dostoyevsky. The two young women should be celebrated to the heavens for what they do together. I never believed so many giggles and gasps and stutters and excited silences could be so finely woven, tossed so lightly.\nThis is really, really good stuff, very smart.

On top of that we have the double con: a switcheroo plot set up by the president's men to trick him into a war with Islam, based on an expected terrorist attack is double switcherooed by those terrorists. This is stuff that works only when it is the spine of the thing.We have a classic redemption tale of a tenacious if not bright bodyguard who made a mistake and paid. This is tied to a traditional chase scene. And the thing is set up as a \"21 Grams\" sort of intersection of parallel lives and coincident fates. You can just see the writer, frustrated by rejection because his scripts don't have this or that depending on who is rejecting. You can just imagine him deciding one day to mash everything up and as long as it will be colorful (so it needs Latin energy) all will be well.You will already know that this film is not considered a success.

But never mind the story as it is so plodding, so bereft of motive and emotional linkage that it merely gives an excuse for the form. The novel was concerned with people fighting to stay alive, with a dramatic yearning for fulfillment so exaggerated that the reader develops similar yearnings. All that is transformed into mere costume here.Instead, we get a woman who was born into a rich, painterly vision. She spends her life trying to incorporate that vision into her manner, but it is all borrowed passions. She comes close to real gamblers and feigns risk but hasn't the nerve. She pretends to be freely capricious but all the actions are as automatic as those she condemns.She has some emotional performance skills.

And for a US-made movie, it is pretty pure.If you do not know it, the primary narrative is essentially no narrative: a muscle car speeding across the desert chased by police, initially for speeding and ultimately just to exert power. This fellow is Kowalski, a name imported from a landmark film. He simply drives. It is his life now. We see flashbacks. Find he was a Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, a star racer and then a cop. There's a backstory about his being a good cop and turning in some rotten apples, so by degrees we come to understand the moral landscape.There is only one other character, a blind black disk jockey who is listened to by apparently everyone. Guided by his eavesdropping on police radio, and some psychic ability.This was after \"Easy Rider\" and instead of bold men moving into a life, we have life chasing an honest man. Same ethic, could even have been the same man. But he knows himself. He knows he is a cinematic creature, someone to be observed and dreamed about. He knows he carries his world with him. Always borrowed. You can see Malick here, the notion that the character sees us seeing him, that he knows he is fictional and knows we think him not. You can trace it to the female version in \"Thelma and Louise,\" where they have their end only because they know someone will watch. Its not like \"Cool Hand Luke,\" or \"Bonnie and Clyde\" at all where the man decides. That comes from the Hollywood western.Its derived from the \"Breathless\" tradition. A good third of this film is spent on the \"audience,\" the rural townspeople. These parts are filmed in a documentary style, with — it seems — real people who have come to watch the filming, having heard on the radio from a borrowed soul.

And Cruise -- well, it is hard to be an intelligent actor when you're as dumb as a flagpole knob. I found my worst fears to be true, but also found some strong, really strong elements that make this worth watching.First the bad. Most films are built on other films; some -- especially recently -- openly quote other films. Some of these are also in the category of films about constructed realities, and that's when things can get interesting: you go to a film to construct a reality for you, and the story is about constructing a reality. Often these fold with sophistication. But here they do this intrinsically intelligent thing in a fifth grade dumb way. Not Monet, but paint by the numbers.The film is about fantasy love and deciding between lovers. Rather than quote 'Jules and Jim' on this in a light way as anyone else would: Crowe puts a floor-to-ceiling poster in Cruise's bedroom, then when a voice ('tech support') explains that the constructed images were taken from movies, we see an actual clip. Those of us who Crowe targets would immediately recognize the quote of Bob Dylan's most famous album cover. But instead of quoting it like Greenaway would use a famous painting, we are walked through it with chalk.Patronizing. Embarrassing. Discouraging. Does he think we all move lips when reading?But there are two really fascinating things. I believe that Crowe's imagination is based in popular music first, with the image to follow, and actors and story getting dragged in a matter of course. So the effect of the music is more powerful than any I recall. He deftly binds it, even having Cruise take up a song at one point. This is the deepest use of Dylan in a long time. For those of us that are Crowe's age, there is a cool take on the Beatles: in the late sixties, the game was that drugs could help you create your own reality. The Beatles provided three alternative worlds for you to choose. It really was a matter of pervasive discussion about choosing (or 'liking') John, Paul or George.Once the topic comes up in the film, everything from there can be seen as making a choice. John would have stayed in fantasyland. George would have declared the whole thing irrelevant and opted out. Paul would have gone back to the 'real' world. The film ends with Paul's song. Now that's the kind of near-subtlety that's missing in the story at large.The other thing is no small matter. It purely blew me away, using a cinematic effect I have never experienced before. The whole film is storytelling by reference; what is new is storytelling by direct reference to characters previously played by the cast!Start with Alicia Witt and work outwards from the center. (Alicia was the receptionist at LE, named Libby who is the first person involved in the dream mechanics.) She played an identical, small center as the whorehouse pianist in 'Liebestraum' (get the name?), also as the fulcrum of folded visions.Diaz played the shunned girlfriend in the last popular film dealing with constructed realities, 'Malkovich.' Russell plays Douglas playing the character who recreates the narrative. It is the complement of his role in 'Wonder Boys,' where he was the creator, but real; and a complement of a different sort of him in 'The Game,' where he was the target, not the creator. His work here and in 'Boys' are knowingly referential to his other roles. Very tight selfreferential acting. Kudos to him, it makes up for a whole previous life of selfindulgent frippery. (Made right by his finding his own film Latin love.) And then there is Cruise himself. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is this very same movie (so Kubrick even said in reference to the Spanish original), but with no quarter given to the less astute viewer. How cool that he would come to this very much dumber version while his exwife went to something more elaborately and cinematic ally selfreferential in 'Moulin Rouge,' (a real thrill that should be seen right after either 'Eyes' or 'Little Voice').And finally we have Cruz, whose reference is to an external movie of a different type: this same film. Except the original is more a film where this is a composite of films. She plays her role not in this film, but here in reference to there as if she herself was Jeanne Moreau. And if there ever was a case of films constructing reality, how sweet to have Tom and Penny fall in 'love.'","id":"rw0759051"},{"movie":"Van Helsing","heading":"Redheaded Absinthed Alice","date":"19 May 2004","content":"Spoilers herein.This is the best summer action film I think I have ever seen. There is a primary reason and several secondary ones.The primary attraction is that these things are literally thrill rides. And in film today, the thrills come from how the camera moves, period. The state of the art in this regard has matured even in the last year as they've worked out how to sync virtual and real items with camera paths that are physically impossible.Unlike the disastrous `Spiderman,' this camera dances with extreme energy. Notice how those camera paths are registered. We see the motions in the flight paths of the vampires: smooth swoop, hold, swoop in a slightly different direction as if they have discovered something, then end with a radical curve and redirection.Then we experience that same flight pattern ourselves, subliminally making us the vampires. The by now close relationship between Sommers and his chief editor allow this to push, push, push energy, the energy of observation.But that's not all I like. While the eye is in motion, the characters are in motion as well in the ordinary sense. But all the main characters are morphing, a different kind of motion. And as the movie progresses, we are taken through different films, yet another kind of motion of sight: Indiana Jones, Nosferatu, Gremlins 2, Star Wars, James Bond, Stagecoach, Alien, Eyes Wide Shut (in Budapest!) even esoterica like Spacehunter and Hudson Hawk. And of course in very literal ways, the Universal classics.Every character transmutes except Kate, who is more of a tattoo here than a character. Her leather corset produces a waist not quite as small as Nichole Kidman's in Portrait of a Lady, but remarkable in any case.I keep a database of films that employ absinthe. This one revolves around absinthe: the monster's heart and blood is absinthe and the whole tale can be cast as an absinthe vision (as was Moulin Rouge). Kate and Huge drink absinthe found in the windmill (as also in Moulin) and the story turns.And another database on uses of the Alice in Wonderland metaphor, and another on architectural fireworks, and yet another on vision in redheads, all of which are in the fashion now. All appear here in strength.It is a tradition that the strongest vampire wife of the three is the redhead and that she subliminally controls the entire scenario through sex. Stoker implied as much at the beginning and it is that redhead wife who captures and dooms Van Helsing in the book.   This redhead is the hidden centerpiece of the film as well as its vision. It features the amazing Elena Anaya who was the hidden motivator in the very best folded Alice story: Sex and Lucia, and also in Talk to Her which was similarly folded and depended on her motivation (as Eve in that case).My only criticism of this is that the winged versions were Republicanized, sexless.

And this film is stupid - like dozens of its contemporaries, it casts evil against an amoral crusader, with the Church as secondary evil. Here we have a Baldwin, acting Baldwin-y (which means acting from his chest), and stock vampires. I suppose the excuse to make this is the innovation of killing them in a slightly different way than is rote.But the reward here is James Woods. I think he is one of our best technical film actors. By technical, I mean he works not on the character, but on the dramatic effect of the scene. He's a scene-man. One of the most powerful scenes (seared into my memory) was about thirty seconds in the otherwise forgettable `True Crime.' Clint Eastwood and he have an exchange about one of their wives which ranks in my top film moments.Oops, a minor spoiler follows, though you should be able to see it from across the continent.So here is Woods in a really unartful enterprise, playing a role that seems to allow no room for acting. And his comrades wouldn't know how to cocreate a technical reading anyway. But he's still damned good! It is like fine rock guitar playing: the holes are where the emotion is. Woods does what the director wants during the `important' moments, like saying goodby to his infected partner, like confronting the cardinal. All according to the specified level of mundaneness. But in the holes, where he is just walking, or grabbing an implement, you can see a good actor. Even this small leavening excites.And such is noted in the only clever dialog. There's a juvenile running joke about getting an erection when killing vampires. (This I suppose balances the mutual orgasm of the master vampire and hooker victim when he is busied with her genitals.)

Well, now I have and I find much the same vocabulary, used in almost the same way but to create in my case more value.If you have not yet seen this, I can have you imagine a blend of 'Scorpio Rising.' 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God,' and what I believe Malick wanted 'The New World' to be. There is a bit too much heavy techno music here for my tastes.

And yet it was open enough for me to put my own notions in it — these probably aren't fundamentally much different than those kids after all.The construction is rather clever. We have a fellow, imprisoned by Norse Scotts in a simple cage. Brutally treated, deprived, and force to kill other captives for the amusement of his owners. The film as I understand it is primarily the movie he creates in his mind leading to his death by drowning himself in a pond.That film is what we share, ordered into episodes dealing with his confronting Christianity, which he seems to know and puzzle about. We pass through the Norse equivalent of the River Styx and find ourselves in the New World where no European religions have traction. All is cleansed; we have wonderful landscapes. (But as they used Scotland for both the before and after landscapes, the vegetation and sky do not alas resemble North America.) And we have increasing madness and purity.It could be a collection of toy ideas, but Refn — probably intuitively — left enough openness and ambiguity between the layers for me to fill it with what I think is intelligent.What makes this different from 'Koyaanisqatsi'?

But for me, Medems world is something worth cleaving to. It is a mix of intelligent exploration of self-reference and being; the tidal forces of fate and emotion and both set in the play we call sex. It is more magical and less mechanical than the typical French perspective. It is at once more abstract and human.Tarkovsky has some of the same screen grammar but in his case the characters live in a heavy world, and the gravity of the thing hangs like fog from which we can distill the abstractions we ponder.

If you want a subversive film, go to Greenaway.Yet, I can admire how this thing is put together. It is highly cinematic visually even though most of the thing is talking. But even that is tricky because the talker is behind a mask, so we largely invent the images in our own minds, prompted from time to time with inserted visions.The first half is the Count of Agatha Cristie, where we are presented with an old fashioned detective story except presented from the criminal's perspective. Serial killings are ticked off and we want to know why. Though we follow the killer, our inquiries are handled by the on screen detective.This is followed by an \"Oldboy\" segment, a radical shift, perhaps equally well done.

Three are ordinary: `Cut,' `Scream 3,' and `Urban Legend: Final Cut.' One, the recent `Hamlet,' is different. This comment covers the three traditional slashers.Each of the three slashers uses the inside film as a device for a relatively sophisticated distance for humor: they try to scare using established formulae, but at the same time poking fun at the genre, the watchers and the scares themselves.Cut, Urban and Hamlet are by first-time directors: and incidentally the characters are film students. The lead in Urban is made up to look like Julia Stiles, the Ophelia in Hamlet. The lead in Cut is made up to look like Courtney Cox of Scream. Scream has the highest production values, Urban the lowest.Cut is the deepest self-referencially: the monster is brought into the real world by the film -- the magic is in the viewing, which makes the audience cocreators of horror. The monster is destroyed when the film is. Plus, Cut has Molly Ringwald playing Bette Midler. She probably knows she's being made fun of as a bag that once was fun, just like the genre.Urban is the most schoolish in the number of films it references cinematically. Lots of Hitchcock here, some too blatant to be honorable. It makes the most fun of the actors: the bogus film within is really bad and the film crew are bozos; but the `real' film is worth killing for, sort of a `D.O.A' plot.Scream has the dumbest story; Urban and Scream have scooby-doo plot ends: the bad guy in the costume really is just a bad guy in a costume and we get the detective-story-like explanation.Scream uses the film within poorly. It is just a place of work: the only clever device is that each `real' character has a pretend one. But this isn't used at all except for a brief shadowing of Gale Weathers. Wes Craven knows better. He used this same notion in the last Nightmare movie where he played himself writing the film. Pretty good actually.Urban uses the film within only by reference (along with all of the other films that are referenced). Instead, the use has more to do with the making of the film and the trappings of filmmaking -- except for the end where the film within merges with the `real' action.Cut uses the film within more creatively. By placing the real people in the action of the old film, thus bringing the killer of the old film to them.None of this stuff is scary any more. When you go, you go for fun.

Pity the poor filmmaker: she has to have enough formula to give the viewer something to rely on. After all, in a horror film, most of the work is done by the audience. We willingly supply all the imaginative components that thrill us. All the movie does is provide cues based on, derived from milestones in the genre.But at the same time, that beleaguered filmmaker has to be novel enough to engage so far as the story and the metaphysical logic behind it. Usually, that is a matter of just mixing existing elements in a slightly new way and that's what we have here.It is part ghost story, after the manner of recent much better films. It is part traditional slasher where an unknown human seems to be always in the right place to exact revenge (usually revenge, here a cover-up). And it is part that twist on the ghost story that kicked off the series: the notion that urban legends have a power of their own to invade the world and become real  the spectre that just thinking of hearing a story will have it land on you.That novel notion wasn't fully exploited, but it is an intelligent a device as the movie within the movie of \"The Ring.\"And we have it here, dimly.These three elements are mixed together with a bit more success than you would guess.

No, not exactly new; rather the techniques are maturing to the point that people don't notice them any more. And that's what you want.It is a matter of ambiguous narration. We've always had this, even with silent movie cards. For 75 years or so (let's start with Kane), we've had the sliding notion of the narration of the storyteller, the \"voiceover\" narration of the protagonist, and the interior narration of one character to another. This latter is obvious in many bad science fiction movies where the professor patiently explains some key dynamics of the story. We accept that these can meld — have for decades.But we now have a trend where we like to have narrative perspectives made discrete and explicit because we like to play games with what one knows that another does not, and how one can annotate another. So we have movies like \"Informant,\" whose key hook is in weaving ambiguities among these platforms.Here in \"Up\" is a more complex and delicate composition. First of all, instead of being built on the great confrontation between the big and little guy, it moves on the conflict between independent loneliness and risk in losing ones' self in another.It is about love, is modern in the sense that it moves the tension into the narrative structure itself, and is tuned well, because Clooney knows what he is doing. We have the on screen narrator, Clooney's character Bingham, who knows more than the character does. He narrates to a novice. He also narrates as a living, triggering change in other characters. We hear those characters as bona fide narrators. We hear Bingham to them, to himself, to his apprentice, and to a romantic possibility he finds. Its all about story, each one, and about the dissonances and overlaps among them.The power comes from some large things and small. The large device is obvious. The standard fold in films is to have an inner \"film\" of some kind that allows us to enter as participant. Here it is a remote video conferencing for one of the narrative threads, allowing us to fold in to that one only. The \"small\" narrative device factors powerfully in the film, but the mechanism is somewhat hidden. The template we are expecting is the standard romantic pattern: love is found, lost and regained. This is broken: our guy does not get anything close to wholeness. He goes back to a hell of what both he and we know will be loneliness. The apprentice girl learning about love? Her life is ruined by a suicide that will haunt her, caused by inept handling of false narrative. The effectiveness of the folding device of video conferencing? Discarded as ineffective.It all turns on our discovery that Bingham is himself a narrative, a distraction, a fabrication in the romantic sense. It comes from out of the blue because there are so many narrators, so many fabricators that we didn't notice the power of this one, Bingham's love interest played by Vera Farmiga. Her power is absolute and breaks everything. This could be a depressing movie if you are sensitive to job loss, suicide and disappointment in love. But it is designed to pass the narrative prerogative to you to handle, so is judged as \"intelligent.\"The inner plot is its own narrative. Two young lovers are getting married. One is related by birth, the other by being a salesman of the artificial. Bingham gives them the happiness he cannot have, that he has to deny himself. (There are hints that problems with his parents is the cause.) He literally at the end gives them his happiness in terms of the credits he has accumulated in his endeavors.

It has all the hallmarks of the Pixal manual: it is obsessed with exploring the third dimension and it has an extremely refined engineering of story. It touches on thoroughly conventional family values in a slightly new way. And it has a strangely relevant short that precedes it.In this case, the three dimensional explorations that Pixar mastered are rendered in visual three D because Disney's corporate strategy requires it. Its a massive shame. That's because of the unintuitive fact that of all the exploration and innovation that Pixar has done has to do with novelties of the projection into a 2-d screen with a frame. The frame , usually constrained by the physics of the camera, has a broader physics in Pixar-land. But to get audiences to \"read\" the 3D, these extended physics are taken away and what we have is ordinary camera movement and framing.I may have a different experience when I see this in 2D, but I think not. All the cinematic fun, the adventure of the Pixar spirit, is missing here.The one thing that is outside the normal Pixar range is the color palette. It much richer here than usual.

This one does, and I think there are three devices consciously used.One is plainly obvious, the cinematic energy that Scott knows how to deliver. There are thousands of small decisions that he and his team made. This is not just loud motion, but a breathing being with electric life. I am sure that there is no single thing here that is particularly novel, but his use of the cinematic vocabulary toward a single end, a small effective focus, is remarkable.There is a similar shape to the story. Usually what we want to have is a human story, but because human emotions are uncinematic we place them in some larger visible context, perhaps a war. Then the flows of that larger scope can be shown and are inherited by the human level. This has been done thousands of times, effectively. Here we have the inverse: the story is about the beast, and we are able to anthropomorphize by inheritance from the human drama of a guy and problems with his wife that are outlined.Even Scott's standard trick of locating us is used in the service of this device. What he loves to do is locate a scene for the viewer by giving a tickertape text (complete with tickertape noise) on the screen, so we know we are at the Scranton Curve. It is a cheat, a substitute for what should normally be done cinematically. He does it so he doesn't have to waste any beats resituating us. But look what he does; for the whole film this is used for situation, until the very end. Then he uses a similar device, complete with font, to resituate the people, not the location. Clever.But the big trick is one I comment on incessantly. A way to engage an audience is to place an audience in the movie and make them behave the way you want the viewers to. It is the visual equivalent of the laugh track, and exploits the science of mirror neurons. Scott's films have increasingly used this. Here, what we have is news crews bring the story to an audience we see as deeply engaged. Though the pending disaster will kill anyone nearby, the people flock to the scene. Video from the TeeVee merges seamlessly with film footage. Helo shots from Scott's enterprise merge with this we see from the on screen helo. We know that the camera on the helo we see is interchangeable with the one we don't. As the tension in the on screen audience increases, and their lives are at risk, we become similarly invested. Folding. An incidental observation. For a hundred years, technology was a visual cinematic quality. Technology was big and better technology was bigger. Bigger steamships, bigger trains. Even bigger buildings were seen as technology, and would have been seen so by, say, the \"King Kong\" audience. Now of course, we live in a different setting, one in which more advanced technology is more microscopic and diffuse in \"the cloud.\"The train is no longer an automatic semiotic token for technology. For us and Scott, it is simply a big machine that is a mess, like the big corporations that are a similar runaway mess.

It used to be that if the average person read it in a newspaper or magazine, she assumed it to be true. Now, that is reversed and the \"presumed true\" quality goes to things you see with your own eyes.In TeeVee and this sort of documentary (which was made for TeeVee in Austria by Russians) the visuals are salted with talking heads, always presented as experts-who-know. Well, we get into all kinds of trouble.The problem is that it is easier to make a good story than to make a story that overlaps with the world we live in. It is doubly, triply hard when we think of that world that we live in as the real world, where we act and reap consequences.Russian science is a bizarre mix of suppressed Russian Orthodox magical realism, a similar thread of Kaballistic superstition and a ten-years-too-late new age spiritualism. Russians are strong in math and engineering but generally dunces in basic science. This likely goes back a century where the society as a whole was told to not believe their lyin' senses and instead buy into the great narrative.I know some of these folks. I know the type thoroughly, as I am involved in what they call \"systems science.\" The way they define it has to do with global principles that we cannot see in normal science because we always are looking at a mere part of a system. This provides a means for them to apply whatever systems narrative they want that feels good.But it is scooby-doo science. Actually, I readily argue that science is broken and we need a more human logic if we want to stick with the scientific method. But these guys are simply goofs. They tamper with data. They aver double-blind protocols because their experiments don't work when performed that way. Their results are profoundly irreproducible. They huddle in conferences and societies that they invent and convince themselves that everyone else doesn't get it. But these societies collect narratives that are contradictory. You can even see it here. 90 minutes is a lot of time to fill if you purport to give facts. So they have many experts testifying. Listen closely and you will see that no two tell the same story; each has developed the narrative in a direction that makes sense to them alone. It is only because the thing keeps moving smoothly that the illusion is given that this all makes sense.If you choose not to see it, the basic idea here is that water is unique on the planet. It is the only thing that does or has a whole list of things they mention. (Most of these are wrong, but never mind.) From there, it has this \"mother\" quality, where it is associated with all life. From there, we have it governing all life. The most outrageous concept in this is the one around which the master narrative is loosely collected: water has not just a memory of everything on the planet, but that same structure provides the template for each future event and being. Also the memory is universal, something like the trees on Pandora; the water knows everything going on anywhere instantaneously.The core of this comes from some party loyalists who found their way into the corrupt Soviet university system. They took the well known fact that water has interesting and varied structure. (There is scant mystery about what and why; it likely is the most studied thing in history.) And on this fact they built a theory. If you are likely to waste your time watching truly useless TeeVee, you might want to switch to this just as a case study in narrative gone awry. This has many cinematic tropes, mostly defined by the ad business. It has monks, rabbis and priests. It has \"researchers.\" There are animations that make it all clear.

We have a dearth of competent, modern French filmmakers. And Jeunet is pretty uneven. Besson isn't all empty style, even though some projects are, like the last one. And he had a distracting obsession with a pretty girl.Now, he's back home in familiar territory: the battle between good and evil where each is personified (and innocence takes the form of a young girl). You might get distracted by the drama in which the poles of these two extremes are stretched.Hoskins plays a highly abstract and theatrical evil man in an evil context. Freeman's normal lazy avuncular treacle is for once just right as an equally absurd \"good\" man who tunes the dogboy. But all that's just context for what Besson's crew does with jet Li, who pretends to be more than twenty years younger than he is.Some viewers may appreciate the drama Besson draws between the way these two poles influence Danny. But the actual drama is actually never shown, merely inferred. No matter for me, because what I came for was the way Besson's notion of camera movement changes the perspective on Li's fights.I suppose the fights themselves are rather ordinary as these things go. But the way the camera engages is rather extraordinary. This is where all the investment in an angry, energetic style pays off. It is not art yet, like Lee's \"Tiger,\" where the camera shows the fighters but gets swept up in their masters.The one blot is how clumsily he handles the primary metaphor. He wants us to think of Danny as a shackled dog. But he confuses leash and collar, and the condition of being constrained. Inexplicably, the most constrained is when he is least constrained. I think few in the audience will even notice this dissonance because we accept the merest sketch of such metaphors and fill them out ourselves as if they made sense.The same with the music, There really are piano pieces that would have made sense in the story. But it is enough for nearly everyone that something pretty appear to fill that space.Though Freeman's hackneyed routine is proper here, there are still plenty of uncreative visions.

We believed the effects, or rather allowed he inadequacies in the effects to pass. And we believed the science too, more or less on the same terms.Now of course matters have changed. So far as effects, we expect more. They are still pretty junky, you know and it may be a whole generation before effects are actually indiscernible from photographed \"reality.\" So when you watch one of these old things, there is a built in amusement value, a sort of juvenile amusement park pretense.And on the science side too. Despite massive cold war investments in science education, just massive, the general knowledge of science in the viewing public has actually decreased since the period of this movie. Its an odd, odd coincidence that the quaint scientific artificialities here which should be seen in the same light as everything else here won't be by most. (A recent poll shows only 40% of Americans \"believe\" in evolution, arguably the one theory with the most evidence accessible to a novice. Politicians who used to bolster science now actively erode it  in support of special interests, I assume.)So.Having said all that, this is one of the very best of scifi movies from this era. It has laughable effects, and the joke amplified knowing they weren't so laughable at one time.It has a profound nihilistic cold war influence. The world is doomed, absolutely, because of man's blind stupidity on both sides and only scientists  of which there are dangerously few  can see the depressing truth. There are lots of great speeches here about that impending doom and a finale where the possibility of life overcoming its negative future just out of exuberant hope.

Death, romance, conflict, resolution.And then there's the science. You have to know, of course that the science is utterly bogus in every respect.

Some films you can let permeate your soul, and others you must keep at a distance. Part of the experience of film, unavoidably, is how to handle celebrity. Sorting out who is easy; keeping a reign on how is harder, especially (for me) where women are concerned. I allow Asia into my field of vision, together with a few similar excessive female lives. The simple narrative is merely that they live their lives deeply, with some dangerous mix of abandon and control. Our vision only sees the cinematic skin of their lives in sex and relationships, but we infer the internal passion and focus.Breillat makes powerful films, formed as skits about damaging sex and recoil. The balance is a bit unfair because these things are easy to communicate but hard to convey in a manner that you can use in building a self. But she is honest and we see her. She apparently had some severe medical event and this is her first film after recovery. She merely adapts a book, a story about a man reluctantly captured by a woman. That woman is played by Asia, presumably using much of herself or what she uses in acting herself.Narratively, the thing is well structured. We have an outer wrapping: a couple telling each other the 'scandalous' story we are about to see. Then we have the story of the romance, and an inner story where the man tells the story. These three versions do not coincide, but the tension among the versions is not mined as we would hope.The society dunces have the romance as simply sexual gluttony, too marvelous to abandon. The story told by the man is one of reluctant obsession, a curse that is inescapable and that only incidentally involves the escape of sex. What we see is sparse, allowing us to struggle with our own voyeuristic issues: do we allow ourselves to be captured by the nudity and sex we see, or do we allow the narrative to have its own passion without feeding it ours?This is where the attraction of celebrity engagement confuses because Asia exists outside the movie. We see the familiar tattoos. We see the commitments, still rare among actresses. We see the risk. It works, I think, but only by accident and it may not for you if you have not followed her life from that of the tortured film child.The sexual roles, incidentally, are reversed.

It was literally a lesson for an on screen film student on the \"correct\" way to stitch shots together: if a shot ends in a left to right motion, the next shot should begin that way. Whoa, I thought, is that what they are teaching?Kurosawa developed a rhythm in edits that has become pretty standard. He perfected it in \"Seven Samuri.\" I call it the rule of doublets in triples. You establish a rhythm of triples and within that you can have adjacent doubles. 1-1-2, 1-2-2, but never 1-2-1. You establish this early and exploit the dickens out of in the busy scenes with pauses, incomplete triples and fugues.It is one of the things that the young independent Turks: Lucas, Spielberg and companies recognized and adopted. Star Wars in all its six films never became three dimensional, but when dimensions were added by others in later films, the triples still doubled but with three variables. Kubrick eschewed this device, but it is what makes Boyle's \"sunshine\" a masterpiece. Where \"2001\" was about three consciousnesses fighting for control of the narrative (man, machine, god), \"Sunshine\" adopted this, making one of the consciousnesses that of the viewer. Then the battle could also be denoted by the doublets in the edits, which controlled the narrative and when.Ah, well. Here we have a 12 minute experimental film that is relevant to all that. It was made before Kurosawa established the standard. This Russian chafed at the legacy of Eisenstein, who Kirsanoff believed to be a minor talent. Eisenstein suggested that the composition of the shots in space and time could profoundly affect the effect. Filmmakers knew this mattered but had not matured into this standard device that we now use automatically. Kirsanoff thought he understood this dynamic. (There is an annoying French term for this construction.)What we have here is a bunch of shots of some costumed yahoos, their dogs and horses engaged in an exercise of killing and tearing apart an animal. The camera itself is and the events are wholly unremarkable; it is the editing that is the experiment. Careful composition is used to convey a disturbing rhythm. Note that it is something like a broken rule where every third triplet is discordant. Small and large segments of film are used. The stock is flipped where required so that the left-right discontinuities can be preserved. A score provides the rhythmic narration.The score is based on brass staccato associated with the hunt and a visual bridge is established with frequent shots of the huntmaster's horns.That music tells us the rhythm of the edits. It is a pretty remarkable idea, the hunt for the right edit, the edit conveying the uselessness of the hunt.The whole thing is framed according to Ted's law. We start with images of a tapestry with images of a hunt. The tapestry is profoundly dull. A voice over tells us that it is so vibrant — because of its weave — that the images almost come to life.

Again, you need both the core notions and the means to communicate them.The first movie had these overlain on our own reality. Beings that live amongst us as humans have double identities as one or the other warring factions. This was a powerful notion, allowing for transmutations and symbol-laden clothing. I thought the movie very well put together up until this point, but failing dramatically in the actual visuals. The visual imagination of the thing was simply juvenile and the charisma of the heroine limited to the glisten of thighs. Now they decided to forgo the overlap of beasts and humans, and just depict the war between the two factions. Humans  real, ordinary ones  appear only in the slightest of contexts, though there is a lot of talk about keeping things hidden from them. The action is all between warring individuals.

They have some minor adventures, mostly related to renovations that took place while they were in their real home in California. Since she can write, she writes a book about the experience that reflects her own appreciation of those pleasures. That appreciation is still fresh mainly because she hasn't actually committed to Tuscan life.So we have a book. It exists as a conduit for referenced visceral pleasures. Such a conduit depends on not having a connected story.Now we have a movie of the same title. We not only have an imposed story (of a woman's self discovery and resexualization), that story is emphasized by all sorts of parallel threads: the resurrection of the house (even the \"opening\" of a certain watertap), the exuberant troubled passion of two teenagers, the episodes of an aging local beauty and the birth of a daughter from her spurned gay friend -- even the eventual acknowledgment of our troubled adventurer by the land as denoted by an local deity delivering flowers.The overlay of Tuscan pleasures is supposed to elevate this project from the ordinary such.But let's suppose you really believe what is being preached in this movie: to never settle for the mundane, but actively seek the richest path (as measured by lasting pleasure). In that case, there will be other films that you should see, projects that are more beautiful, many indeed. And projects that don't have to hide their innate pleasures behind insipid romance. Also, as a book, \"A Trip to the Beach\" may suit you better as a commitment to a new food-driven Latin life than \"Tuscan.\" As an engineered product, this film has something more interesting than the imposed redundant stories. It realizes that -- so far as the film -- it is about a trip to a place that only exists in movies. Or more precisely, the richness comes not from the real place but the fiction imposed on it by its inhabitants. The predominant vehicle for this is Italian film.So we have the magi-mentor in this story as a character from famous Italian films, nearly as if she stepped out of a Fellini film into this one. We have the tide turn with our heroine when she attends a movie. We have lots of allusions to writing, photographing, and cooking-as-cinema. All the advice about life is from a filmmaker.And. And we have the sunflowers. Now sunflowers do figure in the book and in the native landscape. But they -- and several references to the \"Tuscan light\" are here because they reference Van Gogh. There's a direct visual reference as well with a huge Thuja tree, Van Gogh's sunflower exploits were well to the west and in another country.

Most films address both communities, but grand experiments in contrasting the two can be powerful. For me, the greatest evocation of love in film was \"In the Mood for Love;\" little happens in terms of conventional story. In fact, what story is invoked is in the mind of a science fiction writer and not seen at all in that film, constituting the sequel.Shift a bit. What are the most cinematic things you know? Choreographed violence? Languid landscapes? Smoke? Sex, surely sex ranks high. More exactly it is seduction, used as a pull by whatever means necessary (just as with story) — and usually that is sex. Why? Because it is cheap and essential. Because the world runs on urges and this is the most pure. So here we have something close to pure cinema, evoking something close to pure seduction. Story as we usually think of it is shifted to ambiguous context. It is easy enough to make up a story that fits this, but the whole point is you have to make it up, you are seduced at even this level.The essentials are: an inner being belongs to a group. Perhaps 'she' is exploited, perhaps in the way a queen bee is, maintained by the hive until exhausted — then replaced. She wears a skin that has its own being, and the two collaborate to seduce single men. The inner being governing the mission, and the outer the seductive power. (We don't know enough until the very end to suggest even this much.)The two work in reasonable symbiosis, the outer being seemingly ignorant of the inner, or of not being 'fully' human. As the film progresses, the seductress tries to escape. This apparently has happened before. Instead of being reskinned, she is destroyed, perhaps throwing the whole hive into risk. That is as much story as we can reach, and other views will have smaller and likely different ones. The effect of the film is carried not by this story, but by the 'skin' — the literal skin — of the movie.Some will say this is a matter of style only, but what the filmmaker has created is seductive images of seduction. Some evoke the notion of seen/unseen. Others are languid, liquid, tragic passion. Always we are in the dark, often contained in wearable spaces. This is not my favorite actress, but it is my favorite acting challenge: carrying and conveying two personalities and narratives simultaneously. She does better than Norah Jones in 'Blueberry Nights.' Better than DiCaprio in 'Shutter Island.' But not well enough to balance the power of the containing images. It is her arms, I think. They need to do more than surrender. She does do well in leading the prey across/into the pool: seduction is not in the dance, but what is left out of the dance, and she knows this.My definition of noir has a seemingly ordinary human caught up in odd circumstances that are overtly driven by an acknowledged audience as capricious gods. Recent film experiments try different advanced formulas for noir, and this is noe of the most novel: the men she watches are the ordinary public, namely us. Often we/they appear in the film without their knowledge or control.

The beauty of woman and places deeply rooted to the elegance of understanding.There are narrative notions and cinematic qualities being nurtured in this broad community that are worth nurturing by us through appreciation. Here's a project that when you sum it all up is a dreadful movie, but it knows what it is about in terms of some intelligent ideas. It just didn't have the talent to match those ideas.Here's the deep spine which is attempted: Pérez-Reverte writes mystery stories in a magical realism tradition. His device is usually to play between the happening of a thing and the representation of that happening in a book or painting. The idea is to fold his representation (his book) into the story, reaping all sorts of storytelling advantages. Once these layers are established, he can jump in and out of various levels, and so can we as readers and some of the main characters as they develop insight. Layers are narrative layers, story threads, time, and almost always abstraction layers in terms of creating events and creating laws behind those events.But the books themselves have problems. The ideas in their construction are a whole lot more engaging than the books themselves. The actual skill at storytelling just isn't masterful enough to control, channel and exploit these conceptual tides that have been unleashed.One of his books was made into a film by a true master filmmaker, Polanski, and starred someone who knows that rare trick of layered or folded acting, where you inhabit more than one layer at a time. You had to work at it, but \"Ninth Gate\" really is as good as its ideas, and the ideas are in that film are both richer and crisper than in the source book.And now we have this film of another of Pérez-Reverte's works. A simpler book in key ways.One change it makes is to relocate the story to Barcelona and Gaudi's architecture. He is our most \"folded\" architect, and that change shows some real understanding of what is at stake. The filmmaker here is the guy who best exploited the environmental fabric of New Orleans to transform a simple story into a pretty interesting film in \"The Big Easy.\" For some reason, he is unable to do the same here. I think he could have if he had more time to get into the rhythm of the place, which is less hedonistic than New Orleans but more achingly romantic; more poundingly African under a sunny, slightly mechanical nonchalance. The project could have used this, and it was in his power, but it eludes us this time.And that lack of control extends to more mundane production elements. The balance between realism and theatrical stereotypes/architypes was lost, probably unachievable with this cast.The cast centers on Kate Beckinsale as our surrogate detective, who really is alluring, and in precisely the way the project demands: physically, she is made here as befitting of the place: sloppy, casual (unshaven pits), boyish face, innocent questioner on the surface -- deeply sexual and possibly powerful underneath. But she couldn't deliver that last part, the power part. Indeed, any emotion is amateurish. I haven't really paid much attention to her later work. I think it about the same.So. What we have is a parcel of really great ideas. Important, central ones if you love movies and seriously use them in building a life and life awareness. These are all here, but mostly implicit. You have to almost ignore the movie to see them.But along the way, you get a pretty girl, the most intriguing city on the planet, and a painting that is worthy of its role.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw1251548"},{"movie":"Uncle Tom's Cabaña","heading":"The Conflict","date":"16 December 2005","content":"The story in this concerns someone who owns everything but a small bit and the fellow, the \"small guy\" who owns that bit.

The last film depended on its writing and the trick of largescale retrospective reinvention. This was a trick of the written word, not something that comes out of the visual medium. In an attempt to be more cinematic, this film ambitiously adds two elements:--An attempt to be self-referential, or at least contain mirrored symbology in the comic book motif--An attempt to build a peculiar world, slightly surreal, presumably to serve as a springboard for plot turns and artsy effectsBut these are implemented clumsily. Part of the problem is Willis. His appeal is based precisely on the notion of an ordinary guy, specifically an ordinary guy in an ordinary world. But the real problem is the writer and we presume his committee of advisors. He is a print writer with a good visual sense. (The scene in the train is very good.) But he is not someone who can visualize the world first and then cinematically animate a story. This trend is already dead, killed by its creator. The comic book thing could have been used well, as it is the root of image-based storytelling.

One of the things I notice in these, going back before John Hughes, is how the world of kids is divided up. Here there are 5 or six types, depending on how you count. Its extremely important that you recognize these are the right types in order for all else to work. What's new  or seems new  are two character types. One is the black kid, who other than a jive number, plays a type that is more deeply human than racial. Its a notable evolution.The other is that the \"rich girl\" is not only sympathetic without changing, but she's lovely. To play what I think are supposed to be 12 year olds, they chose a darling 16 year old. She looks a lot like Anna Popplewell, that 20 year old playing a 14 year old in Narnia 2. Its the same general type as Scarlett Johansonn: full lips and full cheeks. Also Ann Hathaway.I do not think this is a trivial evolution. It seems that we are well into an era where women's and girls' screen faces are meant to communicate with lips only rather than full faces, or eyes as it once was. Renee Zellweger and Julia Roberts are probably the first big names who practice this style of acting exclusively. I'm not sure what it means. And I'm not sure what it means to merge this ideal with the supposedly spoiled rich girl. But it seems significant, a significant reshuffling of archetypes.It accompanies a more obvious shift. These are all kids from some sort of dysfunctional family. The usual style would be to have parents. If you were missing one, it was because they died. Then the parents could be virtually absent by simply being too dumb to matter. Its more theatrical to show absence by having partial absence.

It is like that magically seductive stranger you glance on the street with whom you imagine a dreamy Technicolor life.

The rejection of explanation and meaning, at least of the sort that was then current. Well, not quite. These guys followed the real anarchists of imagination and started inserting things that really did have substance, effect.They relied on the scientific view of the time, one of them, about the nature of cognition. Its a quaint notion now, that images somehow float in the dream zone of the brain, loaded with power but no meaning. Once awake, the hidden Nazi in each of us arrays these image pieces into a sort of order, but one that is artificial, saps the objects of much of their power and prevents us as beings from being free and rich.(I use the term, \"Nazi,\" deliberately, as the Spanish rural imagination viewing what was then a largely German-lead notion of cosmological structure.) Dali would water this down based on what worked commercially. Similarly, Bunuel would also in his own way accommodate narrative to \"make a point\" about the value of not making a point. So this (and the next) are about as pure as we will get of the fresh notion of image insertion into our minds without a narrative wrapper.Its a curious artifact of history. That notion of cognition has been discarded as we've learned that cognition works in exactly the reverse dynamic that they preferred: its all narrative with images and symbols along for the ride. So if you appreciate this, it should be neither for what it means (as it means nothing), nor as a deep artistic experience (unless you consider essays art), but rather as one of the political movements that brought us to where we are today with Spanish-speaking filmmakers.We are all enriched by these guys and their notions of parallel narratives, often called magical.

It is in retrospect a simple idea, potentially powerful. What makes this project stand out among its siblings was the collaboration with Brando.Marlon was the first to explore extending his being from merely representing a character. He built the notion of simultaneously working the narrative and commenting on the process in an abstract manner. But as an explorer, he ran out of challenges and was ripe for a new way of supporting abstraction. Here he worked with Bertolucci to make his experiment far richer.The idea is that pure spontaneous connection creates a temporal world. The payoff is that this ultimate artificiality is the purest reality. It would be a slight observation with Bertolucci's contribution alone, in fact all his other films ARE slight in this way. But it is also supported by Brando's weaving of a secondary presence, embodying instant, non-premeditated discovery. His primary character competes with the effete boyfriend filmmaker -- the secondary one with Bertolucci himself.It is pretty marvelous. The only problem is that the basic idea is either sophomorically obvious, or he has supported it so effectively that we think we knew it all along -- I suspect the former. This sort of frangible, multidimensional connection is a tool, a means to a creative end, not something that can sustain a creation on its own. By itself, it is an empty expression.Perhaps we needed such empty films to enter the notion into the vocabulary for others to use in actually changing our lives.

Bad artists make you work harder, investing perhaps everything you have to pull something out of the experience. Many good artists challenge — on their terms — but the challenge by definition goes deep and involves risk. Sometimes I am wounded.All this is possible. I can do this because I have a vanishingly small list of films that I know I can retreat to. It is a list that is getting smaller, because these are films I have never seen.

I knew that all the work would be done for me, and that I could put my trust in the hands of a master and let down all barriers. I would have the need to add nothing. I would be nourished.I assume you know Mizoguchi. Together with Kurosawa and Ozu, they created an art form that reinvented the eye, that found a new way of working with the camera. The camera's grace and intelligence mattered. While the rest of the world was developing a more overt visual vocabulary, these men reinvented the craft. Kurosawa with layers. He is the most appreciated in the west because that layering is friendly to other developments as folds. Ozu with the peace of delegated motion. The camera adds the frame only, for the world to compose itself in. Mizoguchi adapts both of these, putting his being into the slow calligraphic sweeps of the camera. He is the writer on bodies. He is the hand on the potter's wheel.(Puts new meaning into \"The Pillow Book,\" and the pottery scene in \"Ghost.\")If you do not know the story, it actually matters here, as the plot is woven into the eye. A man of two souls shown as brothers live(s) in a rural village, married to a woman of two souls. One brother is a skilled potter, the other a reluctant farmer who wishes fame. The potter is industrious, not artistic and he is interested in making money with many pots before external forces disrupt the peace. (The money is connected to lovely dresses, in a complex emotional equation of savoring womanness as a matter of worth of soul.)He works to create these many pots, but the world disrupts ahead of time, so he must leave them in the kiln — sure death. He and wife escape to the woods. Then a dream — ghost story kicks in. He miraculously finds the pots saved, and more lovely than before, upon being exhumed. The strokes of the pots are very literally transformed into the strokes of the film in an amazing sequence in a boat on a ghostly lake, surrounded by flowing inkfog. The wife is sent from the boat for safety.What transpires is an encounter in two bodies with woman, sense and artistic achievement. It is \"8 ½\" but without the boobs, honking and whips. It is this filmmaker's baring of the sacrifices fate pressed on him in order for him to make what we experience. There is a sake cup that he made, of extraordinary beauty and overt ordinariness that he sent into the world and which finds him. Everything revolves around whether he must drink from it.The tragic event here is that he does. We gain. He loses, everything.

Before the period of this film, these guys had one good idea and were able to leverage it to success in standard pop fashion. That idea was to shift the continuity of the line in their music from the usual to a slightly unusual.The usual had been a matter of riffs or drum/bass line or both. What they did was substitute closed short phases there and move the continuity to either the lead guitar or the vocal, depending on who wrote what. You can even see it in their costumes: the two rhythm guys look like stevedores and just plink out standard phrases. The other two affect \"musician hair\" and madeup one word names.So far, not very interesting except in the history of pop. But by the time of this film, they were tired of this simpleminded shift and began experimenting with all sorts of different permutations on the same theme. This film is the record of their experiments.They announce at the beginning what they are up to. When the Beatles created \"Helter Skelter\" is was devised as a way to exploit the fact that each of them could pass off any thread to any other Beatle and have it seamlessly continue. The title is literally from a board game (in the US called \"Chutes and Ladders\") where rises and falls are passed from one player to the next. It -- as performed by The Beatles -- is a masterpiece of woven handoffs. There are five threads being passed around.Now listen to the version that starts this film. Everything about it is choppy. They deliberately throw away every element of continuity. Every phrase by every player comes to a dead stop before the next one begins.Now step through each chapter in the story and you encounter different, sometimes very novel and appealing ways of tying the local continuity together, They do it the old way. They do it with blues echos. They do it with overwhelming choir. They do it with a haunting, balledic chant. They try everything they can think of and all the existing tricks. Clearly, the music is much more articulate than they are about their music.Folks, this sort of thing is the bread and butter of filmmaking.

Both she and Phoenix seem to find a center for at least their scenes and both are internal actors (like Nolte and Penn). I think Penn is a remarkable talent; he can play several levels simultaneously. But Stone is a straightahead guy. So Penn is asked to have one perspective here, another there, and on and on as Stone tries some `Limey' - like timeshifting.Penn and Nolte went together shortly after this to make `The Thin Red Line.'

We have a couple stagings from Bergman even. It is not worth the effort to single out any Frenchman it seems, treating them with the contempt of wholesale dismissal. Under ordinary circumstances, I would not recommend this because the usual level of the joke gets pretty tiring after 20-30 minutes.

One is the goofiness of a 38 year old anorexic playing an open, unconstrained eighteen year old. Another is the profoundly dated styles that only look goofy today. And third is the most distracting. Its a sort of simplification of emotional depth, about the ups and downs of a relationship that seems so false, both dramatically trite and plainly unreal. Albert Finney's character is so phenomenally unlikable that you hope the relationship dissolves, but it doesn't: what was intended in its time to be a reconciliation is now simply a portrait of a trapped woman.Also questionable is his character. The trick used here is that he is an architect. That's a story shorthand to tell you all sorts of things about what he is. It \"explains\" him. In good films when this is used, there's a cinematic expression of this, usually in how the character creates space that relates to the cinematic world we are in. Here, he carries a 3D camera that sees space but not people, but that's as far as we go.What makes this something you may want to watch is how it is constructed. There are three devices used.One is that everything takes place in cars travelling through France, either literally in them or at stops where the urge is always to get back in the car. Its a clever piece of writing in how it is handled here; usually the device is the trivial: life is a journey, you see. I encountered that sop in the popular \"Miss Sunshine.\" Here it has to do with placelessness. Moderately interesting.Filmmakers hate working with cars and dinner tables. There just aren't many ways to add interest. Its the other two devices that solve this.The first is simple: this is a very fast paced film. Oh, the action moves very slowly. Plot lines develop more slowly than normal for the period. But the sceneshifting, the editing, was blindingly fast for contemporary moviegoers. Hard to imagine today, but this gave some folks vertigo and completely disoriented others.The second is the way time is shifted. There are four periods overlain here, all in different cars of course. Not only are they unrolled out of chronological order, they literally pass each other. They pass the same places of course, but they really do pass each other as if time were this great generic strip of time (ten years long) that you tread over and over again. The story lacks blood, as I've said, but these devices would have given it great, great power if a few other choices had been made.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw1652641"},{"movie":"Two Weeks Notice","heading":"A Number Six with a Number 14","date":"9 January 2003","content":"Spoilers herein.These two people ceased being actors long ago. Now they are cuteness franchises in by-the-numbers projects. The franchise idea is supposed to be that we know what to expect and consistent quality will be maintained from happymeal to happymeal.But that's not the case here. The Hugh Grant persona was best exploited in `About a Boy,' which really was a fine film in several ways. Bullock's best product was `Miss Congeniality' written by the guy that directs her here in his first outing. Knowing those projects ruins this. Cookie cutter projects are fine unless you know that you are getting inferior.Bullock commissioned both this and Congeniality from Lawrence, specifically to tailor a vehicle for her cuteness. Her insistence on having him direct kills the project -- he has no sense of visual timing. Jokes on the page are different than on the eye. Bullock is now fat, so much so that her character has to be a compulsive eater and wear deliberately non-flattering clothes in a self-aware mockery. She stoops as low as a tasteless diarrhea joke.But this film is interesting in one respect -- its use of the redhead. Every other female is red, from the RV wife, to the women in streets and restaurants, even to those placed strategically in the baseball stadium. (That stadium scene, by the way, makes no sense after all the emergency cuts made to salvage the movie.)Bullock's best friend (Heather Burns) is red and of course so is Alicia Witt, who I think was the cause of all the red casting choices. We've been waiting for her to break out for some time now, but this project dims those prospects. That's because she shows the one-sided acting.For those who don't know, good actors slide their whole bodies into a role. Less good actors control only certain parts of their bodies, for example see how Julia Roberts acts with her mouth and waist and never the much more expressive eyes and shoulders. And the really bad actors are constantly thinking about acting, so half of them is the actor and the other half the character. It is a left-brain, right-brain thing and you can literally see that only one half of the mouth is moving. It is a true undeniable test of acting. When you see it, you know the person can't act. Watch Harrison Ford to see the same: one half of the face is watching and moving the other half.Alas, poor Alicia!

There's a moment where honor is established and justice comes home by an unexpected means. The charm in the thing comes not from the story or the hero, but from the abstract design of the thing.

As with most scientific projects, the front men/women are the figureheads. Here they are impetuous, non-methodical and pettily competitive as well. The true genius is often in the background; often brilliance is marked with personality 'disorders.' So here we have the obviously dimwitted Bill and Jo as the leaders and Dusty and his handpicked team doing the real work. The rest are content to stay in the background.Hoffman plays the gay Dusty, who has long had a crush on Bill, the male 'scientist' leader. Through some device (of which we remain ignorant) Bill's wife drove him away from the project. This film is about the machinations of getting Bill back into the team. That the plot revolves around sexual confusion is underscored by Bill's fiancé, who is a sex therapist (consistently experiencing 'bad communication,' through her cell phone -- rare in those days).(There's a pretty blunt association of the storm with sexual confusion, as a story is told about a drunk, nude Bill confronting the storm.)Dusty plays Prospero, summoning up great storms to coax events along. (\"Spero\" means \"dust\" in the gaelic Shakespeare parodies in his play.) This Prospero is not always in full control however, and the forces do get out of control at the end, harming the beloved Aunt Meg, (Meg is a sort of likable Caliban, providing nourishment and making mechanical weathercharms.) But by the end Dusty has his double victory: Bill is back and the scientific mission (at least the data collection) is done.I know lots of Dustys, and often suspect them of creating to suit themselves that part of nature they study.

This has been the case in every project (though very subtle in `Straight'). In `Drive,' one world was real, the other imagined. In `Velvet,' the solution was to pit two film genres against each other.\nHere, the two worlds are derived from the King Arthur legend, the source of all magical folding in literature. Every element here is from that legend: the log, the backwards time, the chamber, the ring, the sexual conflict.The timeframes are folded, from the instant of Lynch's imagining the story during a spoonful of corn, to a few days in the life of the hapless girl, to the `film/video' time which the investigators (including us) enter and are dissolved. It is all rather clever, but less so than other Lynch voyages to my mind. The one thing that really grabbed me was the prologue: the setup of the initial investigators (who diffuse into the dissolved space between realities) and their own abstraction of the story -- that dancing girl.That is novel, an invention unique in all filmdom to Lynch. That blue rose is what lasts in my visual memory when all of the relatively artless photography has faded. One example of the artlessness of the vision itself: the blunt device of blue haze when shifting realities. Another: the scan of debris on the floor of the One Eyed Jacks after the night of debauchery. This is extremely watered down Tarkovsky (from `The Mirror').That Canadian retreat: The One Eyed Jacks, is a reference to the first modern double reality in film.

Lynch has built a project around two such notions before: in `Blue Velvet' the two main characters were the small town movie and the twists of his mind. In Blue, the formula worked marvelously because the hierarchy worked: the base was the movie form and it was inherently enriching. Same with `Mulholland.'The risk here is much greater because the base is TeeVee, and that form is the opposite. It drains. In Blue, Lynch's mind could weave values with the `small town' movie. Here, it is relied upon to provide all the life. Instead of the partner enlivening, it drains. Compare this to `Fire Walk' to see what I mean.Here, the notion is to go as far as possible with nothing happening. All must be in stasis. The joke is that while much is revealed nothing is ever explained, and if nothing else, TeeVee audiences are addicted to clarity and simplicity. So as with Seinfeld, the TeeVee audience went along with the joke; `oh, I get it... there's nothing there.. there's not _supposed_ to be something there.'This must have been frustrating for Lynch. He surrounded himself with people he knew and trusted. Many had worked on his films. All agreed. No one deliberately fell away from the plan. But everyone did, because the medium is so powerful it bends the best intentions. It is impossible to work this kind of intelligence with TeeVee.

He makes a competent film. He often folds narrative through time as he does here. He uses architecture as a central element in his shots. He is bold with camera perspectives. He creates alternative and strange worlds. He often deals with class actors who do their best work for him. He tweaks the scifi genre in sort places. All of that is true here. All of that is stuff I like.But this film has no coherence. It is not enough to have a clever space and a clever camera angle if the aren't coordinated to create some effect. It is not enough to have Brad wonderfully careening if your eye isn't in the right space. There's just so much good stuff here all jumbled about. Little is controlled or exploited.I contrast this with `Fear and Loathing' which had several advantages:--Gilliam knew he screwed up on this one and was smart enough to know what to fix--He was able to write his own script. This one has two many literary devices to comfortably be shoehorned into a novel cinematic framework.--He had Depp, who understands how to act in a way that defines the space the eye only imagines. Depp's character was hallucinating and the hallucinations mapped well to Gilliam's sense of an alternative universe.Not here. Willis and Pitt work really well together, each at the end of explored personal territory, but it isn't the same territory Gilliam shows us. Hitchcock -- who is relied on here -- affirms reality instead of redefining it.Usually I can find some clever self-referential irony in this: a story about dissonant perception told in a manner that is perceptually dissonant.

The irony of watching a film, itself a pretense, in such a pretend domain is something that would have given me a chuckle. As there are a number of people like me, there is an audience for extensions of this comic notion.The film features a wasteland of rubble, in the midst of which is an ornate old-fashioned moviehouse. Every narrative detail is built around various elements of the film experience, and the fantasies that it both evokes and rides on. You would not know that from the film itself however, and I suppose that is intended.Once entering the building, having passed the box office (you can pay with a button), the immersive experience is a swimming pool. The success of this is fabricated for the senile owner, and threatened by \"the authorities.\" It is powered by a complex steam device, clearly labeled \"Imperim,\" incidentally the name (at the time) of a large movie file sharing website.Built on this are many overlapping references to film-fantasy borders, using overt film references, mostly from the era of \"pure\" cinema. One narrative thread has to do with a romance, woven into another with the notion of escape via sea.

It was instead put together by others out of crowd-pleasing formula.It blazes no new ground in visual narrative. It is not intelligent. The visual strokes do not relate to the story at all, something Kurosawa invented. What we are left is with is a stupid story filmed by a master. In fact, freed from worrying about things that matter more, he is able to spend time with the framing.

They started their partnership making intelligent films behind the backs of the studio bosses (and much of the public).

It is not the sort of self-aware or ironic stance that lessor filmmakers use.

There are no edges to take us to, no novelty in proving to us that they can stretch and exploit because the western is where it was done first.Here is an example. In a powerful Coen film, the \"crossing\" scene would work. Our spunky girl has decided to risk her life swimming a river with her newly acquired horse rather than be left out of the story.

He plays an Australian actor, loosely based on Heath Ledger. Postproduction took out some of the more obvious references to Ledger after his death and to point more to Russell Crowe, but it is clear that the transforms noted here are of the type encouraged in Australians and practiced in Batman.That character, surgically transformed, plays an African American. But it doesn't stop there. Like many black men, this one plays a character, a role. Some jokes with the \"real\" black man (who has done something similar) highlight this.Since this inner, inner, inner, inner, inner man is selfconsciously in a film, he mugs. That's five layers of identity, three of them abstractions. No one alive today could pull this off I am sure. Depp probably when he was younger. A few actresses alive could, but even they have been lazy recently. So this is something of a special experience for me.Stiller, who wrote this, creates a simpler set of folds for himself, just so that we don't miss what this is all about. We will be aware of the by now common layering of writing, directing and starring, but Stiller is the first that I know to do it like Woody does, backwards, with the character creating the writer instead of the other way. Once in the movie proper, he adopts a role of a simpleton, something he is forced into but anchors the same way that Downey's character to the fifth does.The encounter between these two quantum logical persons isn't written as cleverly as we wish  how could it be?As an incidental effect, Tom Cruise gives us a character that nearly redeems a career of energetic inadequacy.

Blair did that well, I think. It established a solid distance between us and the film, forcing us to use that same distance between what we saw of the filmmakers and what we saw of 'the evil.' This does something similar, if you are not Norwegian, so is a poor example.But (from what I understand), if you are Norwegian, then the effect is inverted because the inner story is the one that is more familiar. The dynamic works in reverse in this case, and it is the outer film that is given verity. Craftily, the writers amplify this by providing numerous science fiction-inspired explanations for why things are as they are, for example why trolls explode when exposed to light.I'm so very impressed by this because it shows a narrative sophistication that takes the folk tales and presents them in a more elegant way structurally than, say, the Danes.Among the Nordic countries, Norway has always been stereotyped as a nation of simple folk: lumberjacks, fishermen and the chubby women they come home to. The history is about whether they were worth conquering and whose turn it was. (I visited for a conference on concept harmonization and was treated rudely because I have a Swedish surname!)

And not just any notion of beauty, but a sublime beauty.The most important development in film in 50 years was the development of noir. True noir takes the direction of the story away from the writer, away from anything that makes sense, and places the story as it unfolds in the hands of a capricious fate. It added another layer to the folding of narrative, one above the layer of the viewer and author and two above that of the movie.But noir is black, or was. With these films, our genius explores what colored noir would be like... what a world would be like under an ineffable drive to recover the past. Parallel pasts, hers and his. Other films in the trilogy dealt with tougher challenges: Red as parallel presents; White as parallel futures.That business about the French flag is no more a skeleton for these than the old woman recycling glass.

In this case, we have \"Blue\" which follows - but not quite - the standard convention of reporting something that happened in the past.`Red' gives you a meditation on two folded presents. `White,' this film, is cast as depicting the future, in particular the conditional future. While other films attempt this more directly, ` White' - among the three - is so subtle that you have to actually pay attention. Everything is what you would do, every detail and plot element from the courthouse sequence. Is it all imagined? It doesn't matter, but if you consider it so - many parallel futures - it is easier to see how it fits in with the others.

Making stories is at root a challenge of surfing between the expected and known and the ambiguous surprise. The further you go into the world of non-linear sense, the more control and skill is required. If the filmmaker and viewer can negotiate a space that works, then the openness of sense allows both parties to imply all sorts of implicit things.Strictly speaking, there is a sort of sense to this. An obsessive-compulsive boy spends his days painting a picture of a ship rescuing an overturned sailboat. He does this over and over for years, each time going through various dramas over his future as controlled by his mother. Each time, goes deeper, working out on top of the prior day's work. Because of the obsessive-compulsive repetition, she appears in multiple instances each time. She fights on his behalf to escape his condition, with each attempt either ineffective or making matters worse. Each return carries the despair that it is a return.This is NOT like the setup in \"Groundhog Day,\" where each instance of person and event is reset, excepting the main character's memory. Here, each cycle has entities and consequences that persist and need to be overcome as the repetition carries momentum and has pathology.We see it not through the boy's mind (with one exception) but through the mother's. This as I understand it is clinically correct, through it hardly matters. I see that some commentors have problems. The logic is not carefully worked out, as it is in say: \"Primer,\" or \"la Jetee.\" But that is an asset.

Herbert's worms are the source of all higher thinking, and the good guys are separated from the bad in how they understand and accept the worm.This treatment has a bunch of dopes trying to kill the worms, which makes great sense because the film is cast as a self-parody rather like many teen movies these days. They pander to the audience by sinking to the lowest level, but the message is one that makes fun of that level. Its ironic irony, and could only be possible with the help of the worm.

This part fascinates me: Disney has a higher concentration of researchers in this area than anywhere else outside spooky labs. They chose Emma Thompson's voice and mannerisms and they couldn't have done better: she is a real actress who understands how to exploit this type of sexually-laden role.But all these transgressions are made up for in the visual presentation. What's new here is that they have mastered the problems of moving the camera. It is striking because the camera-eye does things no physical camera could. This includes highly composited CGI like `Potter' and `Clones,' which have to match to a physical shot. To a film enthusiast this is something special and I suspect that the space theme was invented primarily to exploit these techniques.See it just for that.As for how `Treasure Island' was twisted, recall that the original `bad guys' were Flint's crew: they actually had `earned' the treasure and were only claiming their own. Trelawney (here Doppler) was an effete, useless member of the upper class whose privileged existence was (to Stevenson) an act of piracy. Jim's adventure was the conflict between these two types of honor. That, folks is why the classics work. The first act in the book, with Blind Pew and the black spot on a page of the Bible -- and the mystery of the chest -- was essential to this setup. Now see what the writers of this have done: instead of a conflict within Jim among social systems, it is transferred to Long John, who has a simple moral dilemma and makes the `right' choice. No wonder we are a nation of nitwits when the soul of a great book is dissolved into a simple morality play. (Notice  the framing device of the kid in the beginning: he doesn't have to read -- the book IS the movie.)Oh well, apart from the visuals and Emma the catwoman we have something else that is a first to my knowledge: the credits group together all the people who created each character. This is an important event, I think, because in different ways all these people are the `actor team' who create each character. Would like to see something similar for complex actors in `real' films.

But once upon a time the world of imagination was owned by books, and this was a king among them. Stevenson invented the modern notion of pirates: the business about eyepatches, rum, wooden legs, and parrots of course. But more than that, the concept of honor and ritual among these thieves. Its the notion that pirates had a code, with rules that was so compelling.That allowed him to weave a story that stuck. It wasn't so much the romance of the thing, others would try that. It was the way he could cast two societies against each other, using the society of pirates to illuminate the society of gentlemen. Trewlaney, after all, was just as venal as Long John. All the business about shifting control of the ship, the island, the map, the compound and the treasure  the business about shifting allegiance, and loyalties, all this is the stuff that makes this work.Regular readers know that I'm concerned about construction. I strongly believe that the best, most effective, longest lasting narratives have structure that matters. Oh, it helps to have color, adventure, but if it doesn't have structure, we have nothing to hold on to, no way to map our way into it. Consider what an effect this story has had on imagination.Disney chose it for his first fully live action feature knowing its importance. The genius Disney had was intuiting the importance of structure and having a similar intuition about how it needed to be recast for different media and artistic goals. Its not just times, its not just book-to-movie that he wanted to change, but change the world from one where evil truly exists, to one where evil is a transient illusion only.Remember that Disney evolved his sensibilities when the conventions of noir were maturing, and he found a spot as the inventor of a counter-noir. In real noir, the world is driven by some amoral goddess who doesn't care whether we are happy, only that she (and we as viewers) are amused. In Disney antinoir, we may go through bad parts of town, but some effervescent pixie dust is always there to ensure that good prevails. The world is good. Its a belief in a kind of God that is rather modern.There's much to explore in Disney, but I'm more attracted to Stevenson here. His book (his first!) came after \"Moby Dick,\" so the malevolence of a one-legged English-speaking seaman was already cemented, as was the general notion of symbology of the body. So it was hardly original to (intuitively) engineer the shape of the characters as well as the situations, as mentioned. The parrot effectively gave Silver two heads, and there's only one leg. This would have mattered in literary conventions of the time.If you read the book, you'll note how the bodily features figure, each almost as agents independent of the bodies they lived on.Does this movie leverage that? No. Its Disney's method to take the entire structure apart, taking the most recognizable bits to recreate something new. It drove me nuts with \"Alice in Wonderland,\" because that structure is profoundly significant. Everything here is focused on that rascal Long John, who in the book had a black trophy wife he was bringing the loot home to. Long?

I gather that directors like him because he shows up, works his butt off. He isn't `difficult' and tries to do just what the director wishes. He has been very effective in the past. For instance, Stone is an overbearing director with a clear vision of what he wants. Watch how Bacon responds in `JFK.' But when the director is weak, he has no ideas - or his ideas don't mesh with the project. That's the case here.Here's an example: Bacon is clay for director to use. Courtney Love is the exact opposite; she is a character who can be called upon to use only that character in a film. The idea behind the movie is the connections between people at a distance. The 3 Jennings have a sort of telepathy that is in tune, and the opposing `family' (Marvin as surrogate child) has the same telepathy but it is somewhat out of tune.

This is rare, but so, so very valuable.It becomes possible because film is hungry for ways of delivering that power, so it grabs weakminded filmmakers and forces them to extend cognitive boundaries and refine new visual grammars. That gives us the second kind of interesting film — where the project itself is worthless, but there is some clear new thing emerging that by itself makes the soul tingle with expectation over how it might be used by a real artist.This and its previous version are such a movie. They contain something that I think is important. I mentioned it in the comment on the first one and can only repeat the observation here. We are seeing here the development of a visual style that is more than a style I think.In an ordinary movie, the framing and staging is expository: you are shown what you need to see to make sense out of what is happening. If it is a boxing match with Sly Stallone, you see what is essential: you see perhaps the possibility, the actor, the action and the effect. Its all there, very carefully engineered. In fact, this engineering — a very constrained subset of what can be photographed — is what constitutes the contract we have in communicating visually.What I first saw in \"Black Hawk Down\" was an engineering of what you do not see. Some of the action happened around us, the camera eye moving as if it were panicked and seeing only a part of what is going on. You could not make out the sense of what caused what. Because we so solidly expect to see everything that causes things, when we deviate it is a powerful statement.What we have here are transformations and fights that are only partially framed. We are denied enough information to know precisely what is happening. We know there is an exact order to how the many parts fold into an automobile or plane, but we often see just motion. The effect is most pronounced in battle scenes when the viewer would be panicked in the motion and threat of war. Confusion and lack of comprehension is part of the effect. It isn't just random noise though; we know that though the screen is filled with scores of metal shapes apparently in chaos, they belong to two beings. We cannot sort out who is who. We know that within those beings, the animators have programmed coherent bodily motion. We know that each blow is basically like those of Stallone, but we do not know any of the physics behind it, or even which way it is going.This is an amazing visual experience. I saw it in Imax. Sure, the film otherwise is ridiculous, and I find the cosmology troubling. But it is notable that while they go to extreme lengths to explain every point in the history of why these beings are here and why they fight, they go to equal trouble to keep the visual understanding of the fight from us.I think this is something new, and I can't wait until it is used in a real film.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw2097122"},{"movie":"Transformers 3","heading":"Panopticon Defects","date":"1 January 2012","content":"Sometimes you simply get proved wrong.

These edits had compositional energy so that in general we got caught in the swirl of the battle, experiencing the fog of war.This, I thought was a big deal, because there is only so much you can do visually. You are delivering an entire world and interacting within that world at the same time. It should be impossible. I qualified my comment at the time by remarking that this also saves money; since you never have time to fully comprehend a special effect, they can be designed or rendered with less fidelity.The second film continued the tradition, with less freshness. This one abandons it altogether and presents itself no differently than your average Marvel bravado. It has a different editor, so that makes sense. But for the first time, the franchise has decided to enter the premium ticket market with three D and IMAX. Ticketbuyers who pay the extra moola want clear confirmation that the extra detail is worth it. So the whole enterprise has had its one redeeming value ripped out. The world we glimpsed was coming has had its transport beams destroyed.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","id":"rw2541518"},{"movie":"Transformers: Age of Extinction","heading":"Intelligent Agency","date":"17 July 2014","content":"I was impressed by a few features of the first one. Most notably, it was a risk for them to adopt and extend a certain cinematic technique in such a high risk project. I wrote about the effect: having battle scenes with only a part of the action visible, either in the cut or the frame.It meant we were not quite able to understand what was happening, who hit who precisely, and where they fell and such. This is not new, invented I believe by Kurosawa. But it was reframed by being in 3-D and involving creatures made of bits whose assembly we witness. In a similar fashion to actual battle, we can't follow what folds and tucks where.I knew then that this was primarily for practical ends: the rendering technology and costs constrained them. But it made for pretty exciting visuals, reflecting the confusion one would have if they were there. It increased the immediacy of the thing. This was coupled with their choice for a color balance (something different than a color choice). They bucked the industry and went for something greenish and shocking. This also made it feel, subtly but strongly, as if it were a real thing.Since then, the cinematic adventure has been washed away. They can now afford to have the fights be shown where the viewer can see and understand each movement — so much so that comic comments can be inserted. This is a step backwards in cinematic power. I can only assume that it was because nearly three hours of confusion wouldn't sell.At the same time, we have a massive retreat to retro misogyny, more obvious product placement, overt pandering to the Chinese 'central' government, and less concern about acting.But there is something to be said for the increased sophistication of agency in the narrative. Your standard blockbuster has one pair of agents: some bad guys and some good ones. All we do is see the good guys in peril designed for us to relate enough to cheer when the bad guys are suitably punished. As the genre evolves, the cosmic forces involved get more esoteric and involved, but this two-agent dynamic is constant.So even though we have dumber fights, dumber characters and a dumber 'bomb' here, we also have a greatly expanded set of agents, revealed in pretty skillful manner. We also, I think, have the writers messing with the prior history of that world to build new ambiguities and tensions for future, multi agent conflict weaves.Here, we have Autobots, our normal good guys. They seem to be recast as rat packers here, but never mind. We have the reliably evil CIA, off on some overpowered and misguided action, thumbing its nose as oversight.We have the Kelsey Grammar CIA program manager whose motive could be money, could be honor, could be xenophobia, could simply be a drive for power from relative helplessness. (We would bring our knowledge that the CIA has screwed up so enormously and consistently in 50 years that anyone in power there has to be psychologically damaged.)We have the stock genius-inventor tuned billionaire defense contractor. Arrogant, demanding, steeped in adoring women. (Why he only has 20 billion dollars is odd. Even minor talents like Gates got 80 billion by thuggery. One Lockheed project is estimated at 1 Trillion.) We discover that he has internal agents: the desire for a companion, the quest for knowledge, an urge to control and of course fame and fortune.There's Megatron, our standard bad guy. His motives are represented as simple evil.The odd player in this is the alien bounty hunter who may be in it for something like money. He seems to be a counterpart to the CIA guy, with similar internal drives; he could be playing the system himself.The rather sweet complications: The billionaire may be controlled by the CIA guy or the other way around. The Megatron may be controlled by the billionaire or the other way around. The bounty hunter may be controlled by the CIA guy or the other way around.At the robot level, the bounty hunter may be mastered by 'the creators;' the ancients (I forget their name in this universe) may be mastered by the autobots; the prototypes may be mastered by the Galvatron who may be mastered by the Megatron head.To support this is (I believe) a backstory that is new: the creators used a seed to create the original Earth-bound transformers, incidentally destroying the dinosaurs (minus birds). Also new is the idea that the material can be mined and exploited for its own agency. We see the defense contractor and his team direct the material to form different objects. Some inner soul of the transformers overrides this intrinsic agency.It all seems to have been worked out at the level that Tolkien established as the standard and which (actual creators) Takara and the Hassenfeld Brothers glossed.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw3051779"},{"movie":"Transformers","heading":"Spatial Flitting","date":"4 July 2007","content":"For once, what I see in a film is what most others do. So unlike most comments I write, this one will be \"mainstream.\"The way this is put together is based on fractional narrative. Its the notion that if you leave big holes in the story, things are stronger than if you seek to explain and fully reveal everything. Its a solid technique, often used in the story itself. Its used that way here, almost automatically as the cosmology invented here was devised for what, 8 year old toy consumers. But its extended. One extension may be an accident: characters appear and disappear at random with none of the completion or agency that we expect. I believe that's because Bay is a nitwit in this department and the guys in the front office thought it wouldn't matter. Also, its likely that Bay shot a 6 hour movie that makes some sense storywise and then he took out all the parts that got in the way of the \"value.\"But there's another \"incomplete narrative\" element that I think was by design. The camera sees and understands very little of what is going on in the battles. The camera is looking in the wrong directions, is too close, shifts in panic and jumps from view to view (when close in) as if it didn't actually know what was to happen next. So you don't actually \"see\" a full transformation, or a battle event. Often you can't tell who are the good and bad robots. Often you cannot tell actually who's up and who's down as you could, say in your classical fight, all of which it seems come from that 1938 \"Robin Hood\" sword fight at the end.This cinematic technique is not new or novel. Its the first resort of filmmakers whose CGI aspirations outstrip the budget. But this is a whole new reason: that business of what you don't actually see is always grander than what you do.Combined with this is a second phenomenon, and here it fits perfectly. Its the use of the dimensional camera. In this case, sometimes the camera is as a human would act. Sometimes it is disembodied, but there's a very strict vocabulary here too, determined by the restrictions of cranes and helicopters. What we have now is something new, the camera that flits, that moves in all three dimensions. We saw it first on 100% animated cartoons. I think \"Treasure Planet\" was made just to test this. Pixar created a whole philosophy and took over Disney based on it.Then we saw it in CGI-heavy films. It was thrilling in \"Van Helsing,\" and there a new convention was tried: show something on screen that has similar behavior to the eye we will shift into. In Van Helsing's case, it was the three flying harpies, in particular (of course) the redheaded one. She flits with precisely the same gestures as the camera.Then we saw it full bore in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" and \"Kong Kong.\" In the former it was architectural, and the latter fully integrated into the action. WETA led the way on this. There's a new technology that makes this within reach of even dopes like Bay. Its called preanimation, and what it does is completely model the scene before any work starts so that the camera has absolute freedom and isn't static as storyboards would have it. Then the virtual worlds and real shots are just busy work, all the creativity is in the design at this stage.You can see precisely which sequences were done by the preamination \"director,\" and which by Bay. The new \"law\" is followed in the sense that we have an on-screen avatar as exemplar of the flitting eye movements. Its a hypercaffeinated skeletal robot. It helps us understand how the eye moves and why it sees incompletely.Oh, and its not an offhand thing that the central goal of the plot is a search for \"spectacles.\"So when you see this, and you wonder about whether we are worth saving as a people (which is the reason for the story), and you seriously do teeter on indecision, consider this: we are evolving very quickly in the way we see, the way we model things visually and the way introspective representations are internalized. For that alone, we deserve a chance at survival.Until next summer.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw1686657"},{"movie":"Transcendence","heading":"Behind the Screens","date":"1 August 2015","content":"One of my angels die when I encounter a film like this. It has a mix of things that disturb and disappoint. A minor but essential problem is that the actors do a bad job. All of these men at least has had superb moments in other films, but even Depp is flat here. I can only think this is due to a filmmaker who couldn't arouse them.Oh, and once again we have this story of AI, as if it were written by newspaper people in the 90's. Better to have not called it AI, but machine hosting of human consciousness. And gosh, do people really think a computer virus and human virus are the same? Movies can engage when they seem real enough for us to enter the world of the film. That world doesn't have to be believable if the filmmaker gives us enough excuses to avoid the problems. But we need one or the other: it either has to not be stupid, or it has to give us easy shortcuts to enter it anyway. But the big travesty is the cinematic vacuum. We have forgiven science fiction filmmakers many times, as long as they deliver the goods. We know this filmmaker has been in meetings where great, deep and specific cinematic concerns have been discussed, because he has worked with Nolan from the beginning. A simple diagnosis is that he was a bit overwhelmed with the issues here and simply got some bad advice about how to display intelligence within a system. But I think it goes deeper than that. The very notion of the script was broken, I think. Possibly the greatest challenge in film is that the most powerful things in life are not well conveyed visually, even though our visual storytelling techniques are the most powerful we have. And we do have some things that are powerful as cinematic images. The trick is show one thing that can be shown in ways that have effect, and have the viewer associate that with another thing that matters in their lives. Love is the common example. Love matters to us, but you can't show love or any other emotion. You can only show effect, or maintain some parallel narrative that is cinematic. That is why we have great love stories set in great political upheavals. Or within a related story with tension.This script has a great love story. A man dies and is reborn. He commits his new life to his wife. Others in the world doubt his goodness and she comes to as well. In a convoluted plot device, in order to join together, they have to kill each other. At the very end, we have some hope that they are reborn, together in a private universe.This is strong stuff, full of urge and engagement. I can imagine this story being told in a way that affects me deeply, and that I use ever after in how I live and love. But you can't tell that story in film, you have to show another one that evokes it. This is non-trivial and risky, because the default connections are boring.Add this to our preconceptions of AI: It has something to do with human intelligence; the internet is something (as opposed to a collection of somethings); nanotech has something to do computing; a face on a screen matters in this advanced context; computers are or need blinking lights; an advanced intelligence would not be internally conflicted And you get both a boring and an annoying experience. It would have been so much more engaging if we *saw* the conflict among urges in this new being. If we saw how that was reflected in the bodies it partially inhabited. If we saw hunger for sense and sex. If we saw dalliances world wide. If we saw women soldiers who understood this love story.I find Morgan Freeman appalling in almost everything. But the one thing he can do better than nearly everyone is explain. They decided to show a little here then explain a little. That balance could have been explain monkey sex once, then do nothing but show. Urges. They could have shown urges instead of screens.","id":"rw3289065"},{"movie":"Vad hände ombord?","heading":"A Whole Amusement Park","date":"28 January 2006","content":"I want to talk you into seeing this. It is an amazing artifact of the evolution of cinema.Movies have gone through at least two periods where the equilibrium was punctuated. One was early in the game where various possibilities for the basic form shot it out. Out of that came the notion that movies would be the daughter of stage plays with grander sweep.Then the development of talkies threw everything into the blender again and there was a grand, grand competition of notions, resulting more or less in what we have today. This one film is the best illustration of the battleground.You may not be able to find it, so I'll have to describe it a bit.It is a murder mystery. In fact we see the murder at the very beginning, then flash back 48 hours and see all the various suspects, and there are many. Extremely complicated motives for the murder are developed among this crowd. This thread ends with the detective and all the suspects in one room. He starts the standard process of going around the room and telling each suspect how and why they did the deed. And then this is cut short, abruptly. It is such an apt thing, too because each of the pieces of this movie step on the others, a conflict within.It is also a \"show within a show\" of the Judy and Mickey variety. The setup is that this ocean liner is experimenting with having a huge stage show. Some of the people we follow are performers in the show. Benny is the producer of the show, which incidentally has a radio twist. One of the variants of the movie show-within was a movie-radio show. (The very best example of this is \"Phantom Empire of the next year.)So here you have Benny literally broadcasting a radio show from the ship. He tells us at the beginning of the broadcast that it will be a radio version of \"Grand Hotel.\" And then the ship's cast acts out a parody, a rather funny one. But it won't be lost on the movie audience that it has been folded into the ship's audience -- that's because the whole movie is roughly cast against the model of \"Grand Hotel.\"\"Grand Hotel\" in a way was its own solution to many competing stories and also many different forms of cinema duking it out. Here that is both expanded and referenced: many of the characters are conning the suckers. A bracelet is stolen. One con man cons another. Women have bad affairs.And then there's the regular \"show within,\" the stage show. A good quarter of the movie is us watching production numbers. One of these is a huge Busby Berkeley-inspired bit with very, very impressive overhead \"blossom\" effects. The best I've seen. This particular number is strange. It features a painter in devil costume who uses his brush as a magic wand (and sometimes sends the dancers through a painting) to change costumes, or sets. Or to make some of them disappear.What's odd about this is that the effects require camera trickery, so we switch back and forth from being a movie audience and the ship's audience. the stage literally shifts back and forth.Wait! That's not all. Woven through the whole thing is a romantic comedy, what would be seen as comedic in those days in this context. Our handsome rogue-thief turns good as he falls in love with the star of the show.

Wow.The lead actress here blew me away in \"Wings of the Dove,\" and does every time I see it.The effect of this on me was unexpected. It is not generally liked, because not much transformative happens. Christopher Walken has a small role in the middle is oddly bad. If you think of it as a genre film, it simply fails because it touches the bases from unexpected but uninteresting directions and sometimes not at all.But I liked some elements of the story. Nominally it is a \"Curse of the Mummy\" sort of thing. However, you can approach this as a \"Naked Lunch\" sort of thing. We have the guy who is the writer. He and his wife are substance abusers of a high degree. Her name is Nora, a name that carries huge associations from James Joyce. Predictably, his name is Jim. Together they booze into an alternative story, in Ireland of course, situating deep in the bog.Its about sex, magic and story. Each of James and Nora has a doppelganger. In Jim's case it is his son, also Jim who is our designated observer. In Nora's case, it is a magical being with hypnotic sexual powers. Much is made of the relationship between this sort of addictive sex and creation. Natch.The guide through this wonderland is a newly pubescent girl named Alice. There are characters that surround these, but they are there only to explain things to us. Walken's character has the most overt and ridiculous lines.So you can see that the shape is pretty well imagined. And in fact it maps almost directly to the sort of thinking used to reimagine an film Hamlet as a film student. But that shape is wasted on what in all other respects is a bad movie.

It seems he is back on track in pushing the envelope. When he does, he deserves respect as he has both cinematic ambitions and skills. But I think he got the balance wrong in some elements of this adventuresome experiment. That shows he's once again pushing himself to the limit (and partly beyond). We should applaud.He understands that the camera is the primary instrument in cinema, all else is secondary, including acting and story. His goal is to master that camera, which other intelligent directors try also of course. Those others sometimes invite the camera into the action by having characters address it, or by involving the movement of the camera within the action. In both cases, the notion is to place the viewer's eye within the reality of the film.Soderbergh eschews this, and curiously focuses on the technical elements of the film's emulsions within the context of time. Above all, the film is presented not as present action that the viewer is witnessing, but PAST action that the viewer has recorded. The art of memory not experience.His last experiment (not his last film) was thrilling. The viewer there was present, but `out of sight.' The game was in how the past was reconstructed, in a jarringly non-linear fashion. Okay, having mastered that, he moves now to the non-linearity of three stories. They are connected only by the mention of a common drug king. There is no indication at all that they are contemporaneous threads, except a couple passes in auto traffic.He does a fine job of shuffling back and forth among the threads, keeping the mind simultaneously engaged. The trick here is to make it more explicit that the film you are seeing is film that you have made. The film is decidedly unprofessional, with lots of saturation problems, and motion jiggles. The framing is just as one would get with home movies. We ride in the back seat and get out with the actors. We run upstairs behind our buddies. The only exception (done to underscore the effect I am sure, but see below on the distinctness of the threads), is an overly arty shot of a helicopter coming in to land. Soderbergh himself handles the camera.The traffic here is the narrative traffic the filmmaker is able to direct through your head. (Drug trade is a mere plot device.) These two tricks -- sliced parallel narratives and `you were there' camerawork -- are supported by two stylistic tricks. The first is a bewildering number of characters. But he places each character in a set of local images that registers them immediately. Brilliant storytelling at least in this regard.The second trick he doesn't pull off so well, and I'm unsure it is doable. He bombards us with thousands of images, over a hundred characters, each placed and identified locally using the same visual tricks, but he tries to distinguish the three threads dramatically and visually.\nThere are distinct photographic conventions for each of the three, involving different palettes, color saturations (as if three different bad labs were involved) and different tics in the interthread editing. That works fine. But the tone of each narrative thread differs too -- as if a different director and agenda and worldview were involved. So we have one narrative where the actors are wound tight and externally (the Mexican story) and the motives are romantic. We have another (the San Diego story) where the relationships are personal, and the acting is internal. Quaid is back from the dead! In the first, the romantic notions are based on nobility, absolutely lacking in the second where the relationships are closer and more convenient.The problem is that you need a consistent image vocabulary to manage the narrative traffic, but too much diversity in the threads fights this, and it is in the third thread that the distinction fights the weave of the fabric. The Michael Douglas story is supposed to have great power and be about great powers -- including the power of family and the power of the drugs themselves. Douglas has been creepily effective in `Wonder Boys,' but he doesn't seem to understand what this film is all about. He is tepid. Amy Irving is a poor actress, period. The kid does stoned well enough, but the thread can't hold its own against the others.This is Soderbergh's fault. He just tries to do too much: to create diversity and consistency at the same time: music that stands still. But a marvelous experiment.

That's all that matters.There seem to be two types: those that depend on the charm of attractive women, and those that have to work some other engagement. Often that's the acting challenge.I'm thinking in particular of Audrey Hepburn and \"Funny Face.\" The story and all else is there only to showcase the woman; She is only there for us and we for her. Soft porn should be the place we see much of this, simply because it affords a wider set of seductive options. But it just isn't so. I think there are several reasons for this. When a film is marketed as smut, expectations aren't very high and what you usually get is something that is measured as less than \"the real thing.\"Tinto Brass, in some of his later films tries to make something genuinely seductive I think, something that is itself. And he has a good eye, a good cinematic sense. Unfortunately for me, what he thinks is seductive in terms of body types doesn't score. Its a cultural thing.But what he aims for is casual intimacy, the type of casualness that isn't deliberately seductive, but the center of being of the woman. So when you see the nude actress, it is more likely to be her lounging around the house. Its a study in a woman.A second reason you see this so little is, well, there are few women on screen who can charm like say Audrey Hepburn. The ones that can act go to a different market. The ones who can't end up in the higher paying \"adult industry.\" So it must be quite a challenge for Brass to find a woman sufficiently natural in a sexual appeal to built a film around.The story in this case if you don't know it is that he found this woman as a waitress in a pizza place and charmed her into the role. She IS successful at being what he needs, apparently because its what she really is.

This is why no one can really compete, because there has to be a fearlessness to do the new. Pixar was like that, and it is why I cherished their projects. Oh, they used good old story engineering. And they were quite happy to pander to simple established emotional responses. But in every film they did two things which kept me coming back. You might call it the Orson Welles model:— advance the cinematic vocabulary so that the narrative has fresh power.— support a narrative that itself is new, that does not rely on genre conventions, so that it can hook to the cinema rather than the memory.Well, folks, Pixar might be dead as a force in film. This movie is a disaster. Oh, it is polished enough. It has that Pixar sheen. It is profoundly effective in making you cry at the endearing new character, Daisy. But it has no new visual ideas in it.

Here is a replacement.My admiration for Pixar to date is significant, on the order of rat filmmakers that seem to care about ideas in film. There aren't enough of these, so if you find one (here a collective) that not only has intelligent notions of cinema but also make successful movies, you have to celebrate.Overall, I think this is the weakest of the Pixar films, because it is the least visually adventuresome. What they did instead was explore what I call folding and did so in the written bits, following a pattern where films include the dynamics of other films in some way. \"Blue Velvet\" and \"2001\" are sort of landmark films along these lines, where film types become actual characters. Here the folding is just as radical, perhaps more so because the story overtly mirrors what they are doing.Here's the setup. Buzz  actually an army of Buzzes  draws his existence from space movies, specifically \"Star Wars.\" Woody draws his from cowboy movies (actually TeeVee shows) specifically \"Howdy Doody.\" Each prototype \"doll\" gets pulled into his original cosmology. That's the background, what usually serves as the establishing world for a movie. Pixar even uses this in the first shots where other movies work to introduce us to a world.Within this movie in the movie context is a foreground story: about the value of \"play\" which we are reminded is a re-enacting or borrowing of stories. Its what life is, I think and we are reminded in the script. They'd trade one day of human play (meaning recovered movies) for an eternity in a sterile heaven.I know that there are many in Hollywood who talk about this sort of story dynamic. There are few that would dare to build a film around it, and very, very few who could do it, make it as visible, overt as it is here, and have audiences be happy for such immersion in reflective dynamics. Interestingly, the original comment was tossed by IMDb along with a couple hundred others of mine because I failed in a similar enterprise.

There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years. What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability.

But except for the age, the same can be said of the execrable but much-celebrated `Tenenbaums.'The difference is that although the studio has sliced and diced this, there are still some funny bits. Very funny bits, like the polar bear/ Monroe oral sex scene. Very appealing segments like the exuberant Kinski announcing her pregnancy. Some lowkey setups like Master Beatty walking through his house and hearing each of his children, then the help furiously screwing, then all the men come out to the kitchen. Beatty's timing is great: he has the ability to coordinate his movements with his comic reactions. Its natural and effective.Obviously, the project has suffered from different cores being swapped in and out. The now watered down scenes in front of the lawyer are an example. They were designed to be like the author/advisor role in `You Can Count on Me.' But there is one core, now muted, that I really liked, the metaphor of building and relationship. It was horribly crude and bungled with `Life as a House,' `Til There was You,' and others. But there are some signs here of a potentially successful project.Porter is an architect. Though most of this is cut, he is designing the `Design Center' that will honor his wife. This is just as the country house which he designed and built and she `decorated.' The awry weathervane of that house is an obvious if heavy symbol. When Mona decides to build her own new life, she aptly chooses a decayed plantation house, while Griffin chooses a cabin. Griffin by the way is a supplier of `furnishings.' There's lots of going to and from these houses and the design center, which must have originally carried meaning.A central quote early on: `like old buildings and new relationships.' The cheating husband is thrown out the window.The metaphor carries to the `house' of ourselves -- lots of costumes: the polar bear, the transvestite, the stained jacket. Even the sex between dolls and the cello tattoo. Listing these things doesn't at all mean they were used well. They aren't, but clearly someone had some interesting ambitions.","id":"rw0530998"},{"movie":"Agatha Christie's Marple:Towards Zero","heading":"Tennis Volley","date":"9 July 2008","content":"You never know what you are going to get with these Marples.

I do not know the director, but can see that he has substantial experience in at least staging and getting the actors adjusted to the enterprise. Some of these actors are known to us, and they really are comparatively excellent.One character, the rich old woman, is a terrific character, worth admission by herself. The mystery is kept pretty close to the narrative so you have a pretty good chance of actually working on it. Usually, the deal is that you just have to wait until the end and act surprised. Oddly, the denouement here on a boat is the only weak segment. The detective trick this time is easy to spot if you know the sorts of tricks Christie liked to play with the Marple series. That business about tennis should be a clue.Saffron Burrows must have it hard, being able to be cast as a pretty one.

This class originated almost at the beginning of the form in clips featuring locomotives. Locomotives were the rough semiotic equivalent to fighter planes. Oddly, the script features two different episodes, one with a high performance fighter and another with a piloted rocket.These two \"characters\" are a different as can be and completely confuse the ethos of tough guy test pilot which is so celebrated.That ethos is the focus of the other two items of interest. William Holden, a bad actor by any measure, plays a POW from the Korean \"conflict\" who was forced to betray his country in some unspecified way. He now returns to test piloting and has to prove himself to the general, himself and his girl. Most of the exposition is clumsy, but it is a remarkably sophisticated notion in a genre that was exclusively jingoistic.The final surprise is the girlfriend. She is played by a little-known actress with a wonderful, rich silvery voice. She's quite plain and unremarkable unless you know \"The Brain that Wouldn't Die,\" often pilloried as a bad movie. Actually, it is a terrific movie with comically low production values.She plays Jan, who for most of \"Brain\" is a disembodied but living head on a cookie sheet. The movie is often called \"Jan in a Pan.\" You cannot see that movie and be unaffected if you are serious about movie ideas. And if you have seen it, you cannot see this without thinking about it.In this one, the girlfriend is a test pilot groupie. She is secretary and lover to the General of the place, who is both kind and bold (but 25 years older). When our hero Link shows up, she shuffles between their beds, ultimately staying with Link when the General leaves because she just likes to be around test pilots.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","id":"rw1069618"},{"movie":"Tout près des étoiles: Les danseurs de l'Opéra de Paris","heading":"Better, Further Down the Payscale","date":"18 December 2009","content":"Only in France will you have ballerinas who smoke. I came to this after — and because — of a similar dance documentary made similarly for French TeeVee but of classical Russian ballet corps. This group mixes modern and classical. They are French in the old sense of balancing passion with institutionalized grace. These dancers could have been the stuff of a truly remarkable film. We simply needed more of them, more of them in motion and fewer words.Making a film is a collaboration, a recipe from many larders. Here you have the performers are real performers seen mostly when not in their performance but the filmmaker's. This is rare. They are inherently full of focused life made physical made visible made accessible. We have a camera operator who is really quite in tune with what is going on. The eye moves, the camera is mobile. It has more than curiosity; it has composition out of minor discoveries; patterns not intended. I liked the camera. The editor understood this and — while not as inspired — accommodated the feel. It is offputting at first, then helps you find the groove.The thing that destroys this is the director himself. He apparently did not understand what all the creative people around him were doing, so made some obviously bad decisions on what he decided to shoot and include.

It is a meditation on space. No one before (except Welles himself in `Othello') had mastered the dimensionality of place as extensively. The actors are merely anchors, references for the camera as it moves around, under and behind planes. Everything is volume, space. Every shot is an adventure in directed perception of depth.Reading about Heston's view of this film is a hoot. He has no idea what is happening and thinks it has something to do the devolution of Welles' character. Watch Heston in this film, vigorously chasing a greater awareness, and always being largely clueless. Welles used this against him without his knowledge. Same with Ms Leigh who was a manikin in character and `real' life.In some future, schools will teach kids to be visually articulate, just as they presumably now teach literary competence. And as with now, some will actually get it. Millions of seventh graders will be exposed to this, because it is the purest spatial film -- the one that reveals its 3-d intentions more than Kane, Shanghai, Othello. Millions of kids will note that the story is about `planting' and discovering things and either hallucinating about or recording them.

From these folded places, he wrote stories with woven realities.It was important to him that Deckard could be a replicant, and be more real than those not born immaculately. And with the story on which this was based, it was essential that there be three possibilities, each as likely and \"truthful\" as the others. Indeed, the possibility that they ALL are is what made this writer important.But alas, there are three people involved, among the dimmest in their respective trades. Piers Antony adapted the story. A well known science fiction writer of the time, he wrote stories for kids. Fantasy things that \"made sense,\" instead of what is required here: real things that do not make sense, or rather make quantum sense.No one needs to say much about how Arnie turns a picture into animated furniture. Mildly more interesting is the shape of the trainwreck that is Paul Verhoeven. He may be a charming man, and seems charming in person. He surely seems to sell tickets. But he seems obsessed with making sense of a story. Here, there is one truth; Arnie's character discovers it and triumphs as a result. Gone is the scintillating ambiguity of Dick's creation.Verhoeven, if you don't know, at this time somehow inveigled himself into the Jesus Seminar as full, voting member! The Jesus Seminar was a response to the mess that the New Testament presents, having contradictory theology added over time to serve various agendas. The seminar attempted to use best scholarship to discover in this battleground the truth of the historical Jesus, a laudable goal. The method was to collect scholars — real scholars — and vote.Verhoeven somehow became a voting member, his presence as a \"scholar\" allowing ammunition for all sorts of critics.

I have saved this early Kurosawa for such a special occasion, knowing that it would be heavily stylized. I thought that would detract from the effect; surely that is what most commentors say. Cinematically, this has the essential Kurosawa: layered staging, profound cosmic forces testing human resources and strong character extremes.The central character is disowned royalty, determined to set things right. We see little of him, and not even his face until things are nearly over.I believe that it is Kurosawa's intention that he be the watcher and motivator both. As our on screen surrogate, this places us as both the watcher and the governing truths. It is a very clever reversal of the tradition, strong even then and even in Japan. The reversal is overt: he/we displace a comic porter, a simpleton that in a slightly less modern story would be the watcher. He does watch, but as the thing evolves, he becomes more and more a featured act. Coming at the beginning of Kurosawa's career, it is tempting to think of this as paired with \"Ran,\" the fool of the beginning to the King Lear of the end. This fool is not wise, but he is present in a way that no one else is, allowing us to carry the film.The \"film within\" in this case is an impromptu prospectus for a rebuilt temple. I know of no more dramatically effective sequence than this, witnessed by an honorable man who takes the blessing seriously, and a foppish villain who creeps around during the speech. These are the fundamentals. As time would go, he could work with something better than a two-layered sound stage, and more complex narratives than this simple vignette.

So one must assume that this film is dull and depressing on purpose, as a statement of art.

However, the scenes from the \"operettas\" aren't that much fun, and this is from someone who is very easy to please.The best scene was Gilbert's father's fit.

The world of the ordinary people in the story. The world of the viewer. The world of spirits that directly manipulates and \"stages\" the folks in the film world, represented here by a beautiful blond in lux gowns. She's in between the other two. I'm interested in this because the 30's was a period of great experimentation in narrative, resulting in a few great results. One of these was noir, the unique invention of American film that has been profoundly interesting in movies, religion, dreams (which is much the same) and life. Noir is the notion of the viewer perturbing fate and influencing the characters' world, sometimes denoted by cinematic effects.See what we have here, a sort of predecessor. The previous \"Topper\" was quite strange, more of an exploration of sex than anything and one of the many post-code attempts at hinting sex and the importance of influential sex without showing it. This is altogether different though most of the jokes are the same, plus invisible dog jokes.Here, the ghost manipulates events, stages confrontations, shapes the story. A well shaped story is her \"good deed: to be rewarded by God. See the connection? If you are interested in film, you must be of how noir changed the landscape.

That's even without counting the few regular character types that are there just so that as a story moves, it can throw mud in the face of some staid person. Usually the target is someone in authority or privileged who clearly doesn't deserve their station. But as often it is someone who should be tortured merely because they are too tightly wound.I'm not sure why this is so prevalent in films. Obviously, there's a class appeal, and in the thirties that was in the US drawn pretty clearly during the depression. Though the income disparity now is far worse than then, the floor has been lifted by various government programs. Perhaps that's it. For me it remains mostly a mystery. But the fact is that there is a big story, a meme you can trace through many films.Its at one of its early  and therefore influential  peaks here.The story is that a rich, completely irresponsible couple die. They cannot be sent either to heaven or hell because although they haven't done anything bad, they haven't done anything good either. They simply haven't done anything in the entire lives that will matter. They have to do a \"good deed\" before they are released. (They figure this out by themselves.)Of all the things they choose to do, of all the things that could justify a live of wealth, privilege and carefree pleasure... The one thing they find among all options is to help a staid banker become less staid. Milestones are: getting him to smoke, drink, dance, fight and sing. The key turning point is when his social climbing wife who is obsessed with orderliness is talked into wearing sheer panties \"that only a fallen woman would wear.\"Its an odd story indeed.The thing that interested me was the way cinema was exploited. As far as the very beginning, film was used to make people appear and disappear. That's the key gimmick here, part of the joke being that when visible they are very attractive folks. There are several effects used, some rather well. The better ones include the actual fading in and out which has all sorts of image nuance. Less well done are objects that are manipulated by the invisible; these are obviously strings or stop motion. These are little better than in the \"Invisible Man\" of 4 years earlier.Jokes that only could exist in film.Of secondary interest is the girl, Constance Bennet. She's supposed to be incredibly desirable, the ideal sexy blond. She's married to Cary Grant's character and engages in a \"Thin Man\" inspired banter.

One losing mode was the filmed play, complete with theatrical conventions of acting. This is one of the best of the waning days when such a thing could be presented as a legitimate movie.The story is simple enough, just enough to establish a simple contrast of good and evil, here cast as capitalism. (This would incidentally and anachronistically be cited by government anticommunist witch-hunters in the 50s.) It allows a world for Doctor Topaze to inhabit, which is the only purpose of the project. Inspired actor and drunk Barrymore does very well in conveying both the manner of the character and the manner of theatrical acting involved; much of his screen time is involved with him performing in from of an audience.The meat of the story is that a product is being advertised as one thing which it resembles but it is in fact another. In the story's case it is bottled water. In the case of the film, it is a play being advertised as a movie, which it resembles. In both cases Barrymore or his character are enlisted to lend legitimacy. In both cases, experts aligned with the industry celebrate the and endorse the deception.

Most striking are the cinematic (meaning the camera-centric) anchors for the storytelling. But the most commented upon by others is the exploration of motherhood, supported by accomplished actresses doing their best work.I'll comment instead on the portrayals of the symmetric lives of the male characters. Everything I have seen of Campion's work is driven by external pulls and the men do this work here. The world of the women here is sharp, effective, overflowing with energy because of the embodied world in which they live and the men embody the pulls in their worlds.We have five primary men here. The most abstract is the young man who is a reclusive gamer, living with his mother. Though he hangs with a group of sexually weak braggarts who gather to talk about their paid encounters, he is different. By the end of the series, we know he is in love with an Asian prostitute who is (we presume) forced to be a surrogate. He wants to marry her, possibly thinking she has his child; she takes her life because of some turmoil. We never learn exactly what forces have torn her, in fact we never see her at all. But this string — this boy — pulled taut is what moves everything into view. We only know of her life through him, living his life as a game. Brilliant; great talent in storytelling by omission.His doppleganger is the adopted father, superficially calm but who follows a similar path with no agency. The presented contrast between these two men (crazy vs sedate) hides Campion's intent I think to convey the common tragic destiny of being male. Dissipative.The most conventional character is the pathologist, drawn along the lines of the Shakespearean fool — the only one who is stable. He is assigned to examine the dead more or less the way we are as viewers. He alone can interact with our main character as an unhaunted being. (His complement is the predator from the previous story.)We have the main male lead, Puss, extravagantly acted but among the men we see, the most scrutable. The most visible and the least interesting. Not worth examining by design.The one that amazed me was the police chief. Though this is a fourth generation detective story, it is a detective story nonetheless. So by the end we need someone who sees, who reasons and who embodies the rules. In every other film with police, this boss role is either a blunt dummy who can't see the truth, or a kind mentor working to protect his (always his) protégé. In this story, he is the only loser to the wheel of fortune whose mechanics he also has to explain. He loses family, lover, child and most likely his job.

That's where an actor acts the part of an actor and communicates both to the audience. I have a database of hundreds of such projects.There are two jokes this time around. The first joke is that the character is an obsessive method actor and is played by the most obsessive method actor of the time. This is pretty sweet, turning his usually obnoxious excesses into humorous prancing. To accentuate the joke, he is surrounded by actors who can communicate without showing us that they are trying. Bill Murray is so natural and Jessica Lange so real, they bracket the self-reference.To further guide us in this layering, the director himself has a major role, and in fact most of the funniest reactions. His role outside the film is roughly analogous to that within the film.The second joke is the old Shakespearean bit: lovers disguised to each other. I thought this humor was substantially less clever. The thread seems to exist only to distract from the more clever joke. Part of that distraction is Geena Davis in underthings, one of a couple stage jokes.I like to recommend movies in pairs. Watch this. Think about the self-reference bit. Then wonder what it would be like if Jessica's character's character (Nurse Charles) got confused about the levels too.

I credit John Hughes with refining the idea: the story doesn't matter because it is only there to give these kids some place to be. The important thing is that they start out with the distinct types. In this edition we have four boys and four girls, all played by young adults. You have the jokester, the stoner, the jock, the beauty queen and so on. They are interesting to me only in how these stereotypes differ from the American ones I know.You have the redhead who is experimenting with sex, but instead of being the fiery one, she is reserved. You have the reserved daughter of some fundamentalists who is unique to Australia in my experience. The happy go lucky guy is separate from the stoner, who is the only one of whom they disapprove. The sexy blond here is unaware that she is.Other differences: they are quick to go camping to an extremely remote, and quite bucolic, place. The war that they encounter is the Indonesian invasion of Australia, justified by forcing Australia to share their natural resources. The kids fight back as kids from movies anywhere are expected to do, but here the two leaders are girls.This must have been the pilot for a series because some money was spent on effects.

Sometimes they invented, and that is very cool when you can find the first glimmer of some now mainstream stroke. What we have here is one third mystery of the old school. A man does not know who he is we have to find out after the one who could reveal all is murdered. We have a third that is haunted house. This was already a well established genre.

He is dressed in black, skulks and covers his face with his cape, even — especially — when it is just us about.

But the intent is the same, to charm through images, just in Kubrick's case the images are aristocratic.Medem's project is much more sophisticated, switching the dial so that the sex/repress, country/city, realistic/stylized image contrast is between experienced truth and written truth. But the same noir-like capricious fate is at work through copulation in Lucia as in Tom.

Because a film carries information about the viewer, a skilled filmmaker can literally turn us into someone different for a while. So one would think that being transported to the rather alien world of Spanish film would be a welcome adventure. But this - at least - disappoints.Latins differ from Northern Europeans and nearly all North Americans in how they deal with abstraction. For Northerners, there is a notion of pure, higher values, apart from life. Stories illustrate great ideas, conflicts, questions, and no matter how realistic the situation shown, we know it is merely representative. This is a cultural convention found even in comedies and `date' movies. Check it out.Latins instead have a notion of a world centered in real people and real events where small acts aggregate. When common themes emerge, they grow out of life, so in art we have abstractions from life rather than life illustrating some invisible clockworks. Consequently, when Pedro tells a story, he becomes obsessed with a culturally rooted notion of honesty. The primary value we are supposed to appreciate here is his honesty, then the honesty of his actresses (the nonwomen men are just buffoons and poltroons), and finally, the honesty of the `real' characters.Then he takes all the self-referential tricks of his northern brethren and grafts them on. So here we have the film portraying a life, portrayed in a play, which references a film. The actors play characters playing actors. Some roles are transplanted from one to another - and just so we will not miss this, our heroine is a transplant facilitator who leaves her job to follow her son's heart.Actually, in another context, this could work well. And in fact there are several even recent films which successfully use much the same devices. But here, the notions of abstraction clash. Pedro wants to pander to Spanish notions of Olympian soap opera, and at the same time be considered a `serious' filmmaker by global viewers (well, forget the viewers to judge from his interviews, it is the critics who are targeted). Sorry, just doesn't mix - doesn't work in either venue.An unrelated complaint is Barcelona. What a wonderful place: this city was built for films. Some filmmakers would truly use this opportunity to exploit Gaudi's notions of motion in space: what else is film? But here, we have a lost opportunity, save some colored tiles. Worse, Pedro presents the place as if it were a Spanish city. It is no such thing. It is half African; it considers itself a separate nation; it speaks a different language; it hosts a cosmopolitan notion of modernity. It is to the world now what Paris was to the 30s but in three dimensions rather than two. It is ripe for exploitation for just this type of film, especially considering the sexual mores, the escape, the Alice-like entrance tunnel.

Oddly, this was successful at the box-office, but not enough to save Hammer.Its a curious concoction, consisting of three parts, not well mixed and with no part dominating. One part is ordinary Hammer, which means a particular style of cheese. A second part was supposed to be the edgy stuff, the black magic stuff which  supposedly genuine  was to give the sort of fright that competitors like \"Exorcist\" were delivering.Thats a real challenge because then (and even now), we don't have much of a successful cinematic vocabulary to draw on for this specific sort of evil. Less seems to be more. But the Hammer tradition calls for \"showing,\" and we end up with forces that contradict themselves.Those by themselves would be only mildly interesting. But what seems to have happened is that during the shoot, they introduced a third factor: sex. Now, as clumsily as they handled this, it really is quite interesting what's going on. Sex is inherently cinematic. Satanism is inherently driven by sex. But sex as usually found in film  at least simple films like this  is voyeuristic. But it could have worked in a sort of Aleister Crowley way where the rituals and sexual mysteries are conflated. Here's what they did instead:We have an innocent beautiful teen girl as a nun. She has been brainwashed and is under a spell, cloistered in a Satantic order in preparation for a combination of rebirth as Satan by copulation with him. During this time, she has simulated sex with a statue of Satan while the head priest impregnates her mother.The date is approaching. It seems that her mother (it isn't clear) has another child with the same name, who may be some sort of hybrid between devil and human. This \"child\" claws its way out of the mother while our young nun experiences it as well. That child is sacrificed for the blood by which our young nun is to be baptized and presumably have sex with the priest, after which she will be Satan on earth... or something like that.So what Hammer does, is a mix of timidity and outrageous boldness. There are four scenes in which visual sex is involved. The first is when the priest (Cristopher Lee) has this ritualistic sex with the mother while our nun (played by Nastassja Kinski) is mounted by a Satanic crucifix. This is comic.Then later, the child is born, the mother's legs bound together so that she has to claw through the body. A full view of the mother's sexual area is shown here. This also could have been powerful with the budget they had but comes off like a high school play with nudity.Then fast forward to the rushed ending where changes were made after the shoot officially ended. The one change at the very end that gives this some fame is a short shot where the good crusader is tempted by the bad priest with the offer of sex with the briefly nude nun, our Nastassja who appears for a couple seconds fully nude. This also is an opportunity wasted in terms of effect, but has become a famous scene because of her subsequent fame, and the liaison with various filmmakers. Supposedly, the Polanski interest started here.But before that is the one scene that the film should be famous for. Our girl is on the stone alter, the magical circle surrounds, delineated by an acolyte's blood. The newborn \"baby\" has been sacrificed and the blood collected, with a couple drops falling on her before the crusader interrupts.What happens then is disgustingly effective. She is nude on the altar while some small red skinless beast similar to a devilish fetus climbs up and starts to have sex with Nastassja  whose humping pubes we see from her perspective  during which she stuffs the whole animal in, becoming \"pregnant.\" This is revealed to have been a vision or spell.

You have to use the machinery of storytelling to engage, taking advantage of the power of the devices you select. But at the same time, you have to conceal that machinery. This is a contract between filmmaker and viewer. Often the qualities are relatively intangible, like the way a conversation is visually framed or a line paced. Or an erotic scene seductively constructed.But sometimes the machinery is more overt. Many of Hitchcock's masterpieces don't work for me now because the stage is obvious many older action films don't grab now because the action effects are clearly bogus.Here is a film that once was terrific. The car chase wasn't a collection of clichés, and was thrilling. The bad boy cops as unglamorous thugs was unusual. The various analogies of counterfeit were arguably artistic. The score was mainstream and not at all distracting. None of this is true now, and this allows us to notice other details of the craft.There is a seriously unimaginative staging of conversations whose only purpose is to explain to us. The dialog is stilted and silly in places, as if an assistant wrote right before shooting. Many of the actors seem not to have been given coherent characters.And yet, within this story, one plot device has mellowed. The overall anchor concepts in the film revolve around duals and fakes. Two of this and that, real and not, compliant and not. Entanglements between pairs and tensions. We have two cops, newly assigned buddies and the main focus is on them. Ho hum. In the background are two women. Their characters are not trivial, and over time these have become more incisive and for me overtook the entire movie in spite of testosterone-driven noise.One is the counterfeiter's girlfriend and partner. Tall, thin, explosive red hair and cool execution of plans, she is played by Mickey Rourke's then wife, when image and roles mattered to him before drugs. She is presented as the obsessive object of the counterfeiter, who is truly an artist driven to paint her. He creates impressive images of her that aren't quite up to her presentation of self, so he equally obsessively burns them. His anchor in life is her — not her but a fabrication of a woman she is able to sustain. She, we find, is a performance artist and we see here a few times in this mode: extreme abstraction in staging, makeup, movement, lighting. The effect is powerful, this folded acting a woman within the acting of a woman. It is one of the best roles of that decade, submerged.Another woman: thin, always on the verge of panic. A victim. She works as an arranger in a strip club. A felon for what should be a minor sex offense. She is on parole and is being exploited by our bad cop for both sex and information. The sex is coerced. The woman is his reluctant slave, and yet the connection is deeper and more genuine in her desperation than anything our cool redhead can muster. The end of the movie — a rather overlong coda — has our cold conniver driving off with an even more abstract version of her pretense at being a female. The slave? She simply is an inheritance for the next guy.A movie that has decomposed a bit, allowing this inner muscle of taught/taut womanness to be revealed.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw2376169"},{"movie":"Skuggor över södern","heading":"One Bad Egg","date":"1 August 2002","content":"Spoilers herein.Here is a film that is impossible to view as it was intended. That is because its effect was dependent on the cultural context in which it appeared. It was bold, working to explicitly redefine decency during one of the periodic self-examinations of the country. I saw it in 1962, and both of us are quite different now.Judging it now, apart from its historical significance, there seem some major inadequacies. In my mind, this is very much like `How Green Was My Valley,' which was wonderfully photographed and staged, but which had a hokey, romanticized story and some unrealistic acting. Here too. Peck may have been a loved performer, but he just doesn't have the stuff for this role. Everyone else who is on screen outacts him, is more real. More rooted in place. More naturally motivated.The book uses the thread of the story (sexual frustration, false accusation, cowardly herd condemnation, resentful attack, salvation by an innocent guardian) as mere chickenwire into which is woven many terrific small chunks of language. That language is not poetic in the sense of using the familiar to define the unfamiliar; instead it works the other way and is shocking and effective. To appreciate the book, you have to know Truman Capote's manner of enlarging the small, finding decision points inside characters and stringing them together in an external logic. Lee's approach to writing is to add another layer of observation: essentially she is reporting her view of what his view would have been. (The Dill character is Capote.) The mockingbird is a mimic who reports the songs of other birds found in its territory. It is fiercely territorial and seems to define its own identity as definer/reporter of that place.The film jettisons all this to give us a simple morality play. What a scandal. If the primary tone of the book is the respect for the richness of tradition in place, that respect is trampled by Hollywood. Well, nothing new there.But what we do get is some very interesting staging of the children. These kids are so formally choreographed, it is almost balletic. There is some movement, sometimes rushing movement, but everything is toward the goal of getting them in lovely group positions. Very theatrical, and I must say, very effective. None of their movements are natural, all come from the director's mind. But they perform them naturally, and this carries over the philosophy of how the story is told in the book. Some of the spooky staging is from \"Meet Me in St Louis.\"This film has a very high rating in the IMDB system.

Never was. He's a vaudevillian, a stage comic. Now, that can be funny, and I suppose he's good at what he does. But there's a magic in cinema, in cinematic humor that bites deeper. Movies have a solvent when done right, a solvent that allows the humor to catalyze change.When you're on a stage, we expect the performer to be different, remote. We even laugh at the remoteness.Consider the film humor of embarrassment. We have a whole industry based on that, dozens of movies a year. They work because we enter the thing and feel embarrassed. That'll never happen with Brooks because he sees these as filmed stage shows.If you watch this, what you'll get is a rather clever acknowledgment of this. At root it is a simple structure: real world with Nazis, stage show with Nazis.

Once again, someone with vision and ambition takes on Shakespeare. This first-time filmmaker takes on Shakespeare's first play, possibly a wise choice because the richer the play, the harder to translate to film. That is, the less poetry (mind's eye richness) the more room for eye's eye richness.Titus is very early and shows at least an immature dramatist and even less so poet. Probably, his actor buddies drove much of the action, and the purpose was either to out gross or parodize Marlowe. The play is unpopular not because it is violent, but because it is clumsy. All the promising parts reappear in much better form in later works. (T S Eliot: \"one of the stupidest and most uninspiring plays ever written.\")What's good:One of Taymor's apparent goals is to build on and reference the film work of others. I'm not sufficiently knowledgable to get all the film allusions, but the most incidental brushes seem artificial. More solidly, three films form the visual background -- all are Shakespeare films. The basic structure is from Stoppard's Rosencrantz where the whole Shakespeare play is a vision. The framing with the kid, captured by the clown is part of that. Also, in the middle, the clown reappears with a junior version of Dreyfuss' carriage to deliver heads and hand. (What did Taymor tell that redhead girl to get such an attitude?). Stoppard's layers of viewing are amplified here with layers of anachronism, which I must say are more effective.A second major root is Welles' Othello, which is primarily an architectural film. This is also. Watch it once just looking at the environments, (The baby's \"cage\" at the end is a copy of Welles' central device.) Very smart, including some clever false perspectives. The third influence is clearly Greenaway's Prospero's Books, which she must have studied for her own contemporaneous Tempest film. Lots of painterly framing and references. (No numbers though.)What's bad:Hopkins just doesn't have what it takes, and it is no wonder he swore to retire after this. I think the problem is that he is a screen actor, a face actor. He doesn't create an internal character, but a sequence of mannerisms. He has not studied acting and does not appear to be deeply introspective about the art. He just emotes and has developed the ability to appear emotionally vacant. None of that is valuable here, and one can imagine his crisis when he discovers this. (Lange is just the opposite, constantly monitoring, aware, internal.)Taymor has problems with pacing. Another filmmaker might create rewards in their laconic sections. Here, they are just slow uninspired periods because she is considers the \"script\" inviolable.Taymor's grounding in the popular theater works against her in a commitment to story-telling. Drama is not story; even an apprentice Shakespeare knew this. She is tied too much to showing us everything. A little less worrying about making sense would give the images room to breath and increase the dramatic possibilities.She understands film architecture, and framing of shots. But she has no sense of moving the camera. On a third watching, you begin to feel constrained by perspective, and see a real flaw here. Where are we the audience? Scorcese doesn't know much, but he knows this, how to make the audience dance -- I assume it is something you have or don't.These last three points speak to a lack of style in editing. The first part until Titus allows his son to be buried are easy: bam bam bam. That's when the underlying rhythm of the thing should have emerged.

It is the opposite of, say, Carpenter, who invests in the stage, in the world of the performer rather than the viewer.As far back as `Aliens' this talent has been apparent. This time, he sticks to the formula of a simple story annotated by all sorts of associations. No second plotline. No ambiguities or any questions open for viewer judgment. But he is sensitive to this I think and that is why he chose the most promising young actors that know something about narrative folding. That's where you act both in the space of the story and the world of the viewer. Kate in `Creatures' and Leo in `Romeo' did this. Kate has since grown to master it. His intent is underscored by making the color of her hair more brilliant. I don't know why yet, but this seems to signal such acting, at least in women.But alas, except for the brief scene where Leo draws her - a natural situation for this type of acting - it is absent.

Many comments here say the same thing: some great visuals, but poor story. But the visuals are part of the problem as well. There's just no coherence. If the visual was coherent, it would make up for a thin story. Example: Titanic.I think the lack of focus comes from a lack of understanding what science fiction is all about. It is not just taking contemporary characters and situations and plunking them into odd environments. Adding in anthropomorphic aliens and space ships doesn't count. What you need is to be projected into a world that is similar, but extrapolated. The strangeness should charm and prompt the imagination. When the production is purely animated, the possibilities are greater, which makes this a bigger disappointment than Lucas' recent folly.Only the `wake angel' segment is coherent, where the notions of extrapolation and image merge. Though the ice crystals and hydrogen planet are brilliant in the visual sense, they are not grounded in where they take our imagination. The lesson: visuals must be more than grounded in the dramatic -- in the imagination as well. I've noted this problem in other films where the actors' sensibility is correct dramatically but misses the fact that the center of the film is in the viewer's mind.Think about the `Star Wars' saga. It used deep religious archetypes (starting with the stuff of the viewer's mind). While it started with a story about government conflict, it morphed into familial conflict, our most deepseated emotions. A very clever placing of the center of the films in your own mind where your imagination can gloss over stuff like the thin plot, poor acting, etc. None of that here. It's why Pixar will win and these folks have already folded.Other strangenesses: I suppose that they began with the notion of homage to all the prior space films. If so, over time they transformed this into simply borrowing existing cliches. How can you be new when you set the tone at the beginning that, for example, all the space ships you see here will be just like you expect them to look.The girl here is clearly derivative of Disney's recent move into non-North European types, but with a larger bottom and harder face. Garofalano is the best actor, making the others seem thin. Did we really need the Yoda imitation? The innovation here is the moving camera.

A central character (usually one, usually a random man) struggles with how he is buffeted; comes perhaps to understand it and in the normal form achieves points in the game that puts him at the same level as the viewer. We are a sophisticated people, and this has been around for a long time — and in cinema and cinematically influenced art as well. So we have some clever adaptations and twists. One common form is the massive, all-controlling conspiracy. Another is the modern detective story where the discovery is about the detective's self as much as grokking the murder. Yet another is the con story where we follow the controller's actions but only at the end discover the means of manipulation.Here we have another variant, which is essentially a detective story to discover who is the control over the world that is manipulating our random guy, aptly named Smiley. It shares elements of the three examples above, but allows for a deeper texture because it recalls worlds that have dynamics we understand. So a talented filmmaker can reference these.And boy do we have a talented filmmaker!One world is simply the world of men with power and how they perform small ballets in their relationships one to another to be top dog, using deniable, even unconscious tactics. This becomes the foremost world in this film, and gives our main actors something to use. All of them are first rate; all respond with insights from the craft. Kathy Bates is perfectly placed as a displaced analyst with enough vision to value 'her boys' for their sexual attractiveness at the top of the heap we see.Another world is the cold war. It was hot when the book appeared, but the book already was treating it as a sort of fantasy world that came with prefabricated rules. In some ways, it has taken until now for this perspective to fully mature so that this film in this time can be far deeper than the original novel was in its time. Frankly, in its time it was trash for airport reading, of the Grisham variety. Yet another world is that of Britain in the early seventies. This was a bleak country, still not recovered from the war while its adversaries were soaring. It clung to the US instead of the continent. There is a wistful desire to please the master here that hits home for this US viewer, knowing what I know about the relationships of the intel communities.And we have the inner, personal world of loves, companions, friends, trust and sex. These are always where the bones of a story rest, and are broken.All of these are noir worlds, all manipulated by various controls (Controls, as a proper noun).All of these are masterfully called, merged and presented with us unsure of what we control.Already, I have this as a candidate for one of my two rare selections of the most important films of 2012 (my 'Fours').See it.

Because the market likes to sell discrete things, it sustains a metanarrative that you buy one experience at a time and they manage the interstitial connections among those experiences. It is why the celebrity machine is so well managed, as a controlled connection among discrete films.But I like to create my own experience, my own connectives. Among the benefits is the possibility of encountering a dreadful movie like this and seeing it with real relish. Yes, I know there is the \"camp\" game, and the related nostalgia amusements. But that depends on living in regrets. You can do better.I've been studying baseball, and where its appeal might be. It is a profoundly boring game. It has teams but that is only to organize what is a solitary competition. Each player is not there primarily to win the game, but to beat history. The competitive unit is a career, not a game. The narrative one finds in baseball is not in the packaged, sold unit, but in the connectives that fans can make. These can be as rich as the skill of the viewer over his experience in the game allows.It was a real insight, this, that baseball is a sport that allows creative, freeflowing personal narrative to be constructed — even passed down from father to son — outside the bounds of the marketplace. Its all about statistical connectives. A life in constructed narrative in film doesn't have the advantages that statistics provides for baseball. But it has something as good: overlap in genre and players.This film is a great setup for such an adventure. The plot has to do with observers from the future who can travel from (what amounts to) film to film, watching the explosive narrative unfold. They are not allowed to get involved because that would \"change history.\" We, of course do the same thing, jumping from one time to another, one tragedy to another. In one of these times/films is a hapless Jeff Daniels, who lives in his own drama, carrying his own observer to his pain in the usual device of an alert, knowing daughter. She's the girl from \"Jurassic Park\" if you would rather play that game than mine. I'm off into genreland skipping from \"Plan 9\" through Riddick, Fugitive and Waterworld — a sort of tourism that follows Twohy as he visits one resort after another.Our new time traveller, Daniels, is known to me as the guy who jumped from here with his magical passport to \"Pleasantville\" and then back to \"Dumb and Dumber.\" Once you find this portal among movies, you are free from the expectations of the market and can grow your own life in film.Its a \"Purple Rose of Cairo\" kind of thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw2106590"},{"movie":"Timecode","heading":"Space Code","date":"24 September 2001","content":"Architectural LocationSpoilers herein.Much has been made of the three experimental techniques used here: unbroken takes; four screens; heavy improvisation. But there is a powerful effect that seems to be overlooked.Film is inescapably two-dimensional, and many clever tricks of different types have been used to give meat to the narrative eye. The most interesting of these concern how to introduce visceral notions of space. Studying these is one of my film hobbies -- there are many clever ideas, but nothing with the immediacy seen here.Its because very soon, you understand that the four cameras are near each other and all deal with the same time. People move from one frame to another, with the view often overlapping. In `regular' film, you get used to a single eye. Talented directors will play with this single note, shifting between god, an invisible person, the perspective of a character, the position of a virtual audience. Here, all cameras are uncompromisingly human, but because you always have these four eyes, you are given a particularly deep notion of space. In fact, it is hyper-real: a richer feel of depth than you can get with your own eyes.Figges is particularly aware of this effect (though it doesn't come up in his DVD comments). The primary narrative involves the fellow splitting his attention (between two women) and involves the notion of films about film. It has a primary character who `listens' in on other frames, from (mostly) a car, expanding her virtual space.

But here is the troubling thing. The producers — The History Channel — believe that their audience cannot understand concepts. We won't be able to think of things in terms of the things themselves: tribalism, fear, manipulation, pride-by-conquer. We have to translate every one of these to a human face. So we duly have three or four actual people. This is good, because witnesses matter, both living and dead. But very quickly the pandering starts: a victim girl confronts her perpetrator father; an orphan refuses to forgive the newly born- again neighbor who killed his family; a woman struggles with daily life. One talking head tells us that because of the culture, the emotions are far deeper than what we see. It is the rivers of individual grief that we are given.No one involved seem to notice that this, this precisely.

He has an architectural imagination, places his sophisticated humor at the metalevel, and on this project had the support of the `spiritual' Beatle. So each time I come to it, I base the experience on an overly generous acceptable of the world he creates.The story is as much about himself as anything, I suppose, with his being swept into one world after another `stealing' this and that.He has succeeded on only one project, I think - `Fear and Loathing.' Until then, he tried something beyond his grasp: the notion that the world has charmingly incoherent (and funny) pockets. Or that there are hidden layers in ordinary reality that just need the right eye. Or even in Brazil, the rather common twist that of the other way around - that reality is the illusion. Only in `Fear' is this collapsed to a simple mechanism of a wholly created world in the mind of a brilliant, drug-addled madman. On that he could have finally approached the more ambitious `Don Quixote' from the other side as it were.One of the touchstones on that path is this project. Some visual imagination, but one gets the impression that none of the vignettes realized that flash of inspiration he had before his attention swooped off in another direction. The `play with' idea - always the safe haven for self-reference - is here a Punch and Judy play. I don't know whether we have to wait until he is dead before we start synthesizing his work into one huge movie of large chunks similar to the smaller chunks in each one.

Within the film are two overlapping realities. And both are lapped onto a specific, well known poem. And the pace of the thing is slow enough for us to steep in ambiguities. Also it has Helena, which in addition to her other charms she will always carry the honesty of Dove Wings and the layering of Fight Club.So this is a textbook case of what I study. But the reason I am interested is because it can be used to make films, more precisely the narrative capture in films, more effective. But this is not a very good film. Why? Because like many others, the layered mechanics is all there is. These techniques can build a skeleton that runs, but you need blood.No blood here. You can see that in the first few moments, or hear it. The score has that sort or wandering piano, one note at a time over mellow violins.

So she makes a film about a lovely girl sent to the Chinese outback to learn how ordinary people think agriculturally.The girl ends up feeling she has to prostitute herself to find her way back home. And so with Ms Chen, and as with the girl, we the viewer get some superficial pleasure.This is a simple film, and one can see that it was made by someone with an actor's sensibility. The story is extremely economical, so much so that the camera is anchored to the actors. Every shot is an actor's shot: either to place the actor in a scene or to show the actor acting. The one exception is a rather heavihanded cloud metaphor. This works because the project has such low ambition, but it has the effect of abstracting the story so much we just don't care.A more experienced filmmaker might work at defining the situation, setting up some complex dynamics in the world and then placing some characters within those dynamics. That way we watch them in a context that we understand. Bertolucci did that with `The Last Emperor' in which Ms Chen worked as one of those actors responding to their environment. Here, she has it the other way around. We still get the wilderness, the political idealism and associated petty tyrants. But they are the the other way around, what our heroine sees. We, through our surrogate the camera eye, never see the bigger picture.In a sense, this is a `Taxi Driver' bet, a first film where we get things through one character's mind. It worked for Scorsese because he was fearless in putting us on the edge. This project was clearly designed that way, like `taxi' with the edge being in the sexual exploitation of a young girl. But Ms Chen backs away when the chips are down. Some more visual pain, more explicit images, more of a linkage of loneliness to the environment (for example in the Bertolucci `Sheltering Sky').So what we end up with is a small film where everything seems competent but nothing works quite right.

I was reminded that the effects in that (and Iron Man 3, which I also recently saw) had personality in roughly the same way that Hitchock's camera can be said to have introduced personality.Things flow in those films in ways that subtly excite. When we have masses of something, the mass seems heavy, full of urge and power. We don't just see spectacle, we understand it. Here, we have a few grand vistas, many large elaborate environments and many huge armies, often in battle. There is scant choreography of the marvelous kind that Yimou Zhang gives us. It is instead just massive staging with a conventional camera — the sort of thing that Mel Gibson gave with his Scottish movie. It was forgivable then.

This was an era when the film world was just on an edge, when it nearly happened that explicit sex almost became a folded, natural part of mainstream movies. Almost happened, and the residue is that some porn movies have very clever, very cinematic and intelligent ideas compared to ordinary filmdom.I don't understand exactly what happened to prevent this; what societal forces were at work. Its too easy to blame the usual suspects. But in any case, what we have now is an odd mix of conventions: unduly exaggerated importance given to exposed breasts (mostly stage props, artificially \"enhanced\"), a larger emphasis on watching women as the core of sex, very strange accidents of strategically placed sheets that remind us that there is a camera in the room and that what we see is carefully staged. And because the simulated sex is implied, it gets exaggerated so the actors are forced into extreme, dramatic postures and motions that in non-sex acting would even embarrass Booth.Oh well, back to this. It is unavailable by mainstream means so I will have to describe it, which means the spoiler indicator.A lovely, young woman is extremely wealthy, having inherited her father's fortune. She is married to a stern architect. We learn early that she was repeatedly molested by her father and now is obsessed with his attentions, so much so she is deranged. What we see could be her own hallucinations, but they are presented as a horrible reality.The key to this \"other world\" is a large mirror that was in her bedroom during the episodes with her father. A witness of sorts. Now it is in the attic, where she repairs to masturbate. She does so one day and the mirror comes alive. The man in the mirror is half demon and half her father. The same actor plays the aggressive demon-rapist and the father in flashbacks.Our first encounter is him coming out of the mirror in a point of view shot that approaches our heroine's crotch and literally enters her a half a foot or so. Must have been a medical camera. The reaching hands in this scene were reminiscent of \"Repulsion,\" with much the same tone. She then enters the mirrorworld three times. The first is for a lesbian encounter with a childhood friend. This part was confusing. This \"friend\" might have been the woman who is now her maid. Hard to tell. At the end, that partner is pulled away.The second visit is to an Alice in Wonderland tableau where among a teaparty orgy is a woman literally on her hands and knees on a platter on the table, ready to be consumed from behind. Many stupid porn motions here, ending with our visiting heroine looking into the face of this sacrificial lamb and seeing her own face. She returns to reality.Somewhere in here, about now I think is the only segment that follows the normal porn convention: sex between the maid and the chauffeur, inserted for no story-driven reason. We discover they are siblings and both lust after the beleaguered girl.Now, finally, she enters the mirror for the last time, drawn by her father-demon's seductions. Each time she goes unwillingly. This time, she discovers that she is trapped in a purgatory with sexual tortures. I watched this with the 1911 \"L'Inferno,\" from which images are clearly drawn. Its similarly amateurish, the effects and the intended horrific effect  in both films. Another influence is \"Flaming Creatures.\"The thing ends with our woman going mad realizing she never will return to the real world and must endure an eternity of sexual torture. Meanwhile, we see her own daughter in front of the mirror beginning the same cycle.The odd thing is that it is a truly effective horror film. It gives me the willies just thinking about it. Odd how such poor production values don't get in the way if other ones in important locations are good enough. Though Catherine Breillat's film's are similarly motivated, and can be equally  what we call \"explicit\"  and of course are better produced, this seemed more terrifying, as if it were a screeching street poem from a bag lady on her way down for the final count.

Smith had done \"Flaming Creatures\" (and similar), which imposed a floating narrative over apparently disconnected images. \"La Jetee\" used stills to compose a hauntingly effective science fiction \"movie,\" loosely remade as \"12 Monkeys.\" And Greenaway had made a series of early movies with extremely rich dialog over dreaming images. If you know all these, you could have a machine generate \"Thriller,\" and that's what seems to have happened.This is a series of stills and simple shots. Some are of an opera.

The story dynamics are simple. Its the migration of the noir plot to the spy world: average guy has the world unexpectedly conspire against him, and he deals with it cleverly. The novelty here isn't the spy-ness; the CIA would later be exchangeable for any secret conspirator who has god-like powers.The novelty  at least in the book  is that the character played by Redford was a professional reader of books. Its what he did as an obsession and what he was employed to do for the Agency. He looks for sense, hidden clues to a larger sense in the world. While the reader of the spy book is reading, trying to explain the incomprehensible forces, trying to chart cause, the character in the book is doing the same thing.

There is a love story of sorts. His real girlfriend has been killed and he randomly picks a woman to hide with. This is Faye Dunaway whose makeup, acting skills and lines are sadly inadequate.So, its an interesting construction. By today's standards it is slow, offensively simplistic and overall poorly made.

It is by Somerset Maugham, adapted by the producer and starring Orson Welles. Orson was deep into his newly found soulmate and had just finished Mr. Arkadin, something special. The story is of a man, Orson's character, who makes an enemy. This enemy vows to destroy his spirit and begins to enter Orson's dreams. In \"real life\" he acknowledges having done so. This drives Orson mad, and to his death.Orson understood this notion of folded acting, where several layers of character as well as story are supported. We aren't at all sure what is dream, what is imagined and real. We are not sure who is the narrator: Orson, the enemy or some third observer. Orson supports all three. It is marvelous. We may never have another one with this depth.This final story is masterfully prepared by the two previous stories. The first is of mysteries in an art museum. Objects disappear, and a certain painting's frameglass breaks. The fold is that the most engaging painting in the building is the one whose glass breaks. It is painted by an unknown. We learn that this painter, now dead, occupies the house in the painting, with a couple others who were \"assigned\" to the painting. The house contains the art objects stolen from the museum. The story concerns the constraints of the folded medium, and how difficult it is to keep painting the painting once you are in it.The second story is a more ordinary fold: the framing of a friend for a murder, convincing that friend that he is guilty.

It is Marvel, who time after time think a hard punch is an effective punch, color is the same as effect and shout equals passion. Their use of the visual art of cinema is roundly uncinematic, just as Shanghai is profoundly dumb architecturally and for the same reason.They know this, and also know that their films may not be remembered kindly - affecting aftermarket sales. Of all the entertainment businesses, Marvel knows that markets change and the real moneymakers are those that can be sold into new media pockets.So what do they do? Well, I have seen two Marvels this summer. With the latest X, they decided to add some story for a change.But here they tried another tack, and it is worth noting. The dramatic world of Marvel is Greek with teen angst added in and everything taken to excess. There clearly was a market for that. But since the production of the films is so tightly controlled and homogeneous, to sell more tickets, you need a differentiator. The angst and volume is already stretched as far as they know how, so why not stretch the dramatic center from Sophoclesto Shakespeare. So bring in Branagh and allow him to populate the thing with actors who can appear 'Shakespearean.'It is less important that we actually witness Shakspeare, the folds, introspections and narrative loops, than we think we do, we get stentorian presence. No one is going to deride Anthony Hopkins for this, because he is a lost cause among serious actors. But the real tragedy is Ms Portman, who with Skarsgård can really act and who knows how to support a vision like Kenneth would have for his 'Hamlet.' But that is not his job here. His job is to take loud things and give them the smell of Shakespeare.Natalie, like her character, can only watch in horror as this is visited on her, and disaster is grown.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","id":"rw2447362"},{"movie":"Rymdens demoner","heading":"The Impedimenta","date":"31 December 2004","content":"You know, it is a rather cheap shot to poke fun at old science fiction movies.

When I watch these, I watch for how the thing becomes aware of itself.Note two pieces of apparatus. The first is the device that the scientist builds which allows something like video telephony.

Add up how much of the story has to do with this device, which has nothing at all to do with the main point of the story. Funny, huh?The other device is equally interesting and common. It comes I think from a long tradition of physical models in drama. I'm collecting examples for a book under the common theme of orreries, These traditionally are physical models of the solar system, often very large and in the control of some evil magician. By manipulating the model, changes occur in the world. The science fiction version of this is the crude model of atoms which was common in the fifties and many kids erroneously are still taught.You know the thing: a bunch of balls in the middle and some other balls on a spherical orbit.

He, like some other performers I suppose, can only live, can only actually breath on a stage, and then only if it is bigger and more dynamic than any ever created. If I had seen the show, I would likely have left crying about the huge waste of resources, the fantastic color budget, there only to suspend a shaky being and the shakier admiration we grew to need.The form of the film is set up to keep us from reminding ourselves that we are not seeing a concert. Instead we are seeing stuff that would have been culled for a terse \"making of\" DVD extra, one focused on how the most expensive and elaborate stage show in history was put together. Jackson would never have allowed us to see him as a human, never allowed us to see him not trying hard. He would have hidden what he knew to be his great weaknesses — that he was never allowed to develop a mind, a means of articulation, any semblance of connection to the world outside his craft. If it were possible for him to know about this, it would be a hell for him, knowing that we can see him as he is, not as he invented the image:He knows music and movement at an intuitive level, perhaps qualifying as genius, but he cannot speak more than four words that are genuine, even when it comes to the music. He is a master showman, but unable to imagine anything at all, instead only see what others have done for him and intuit how it needs to bend to fit him in. There are sequences here that you can see someone was clever with, for instance a sequence which would have him composited into old movies. He is terminally uncomfortable in this, and one can imagine the angst of identity he carried home and which had to be drugged away. The man shown here as his trusted collaborator (credited as \"director\") was who killed Jackson, by shifting the only world he knew.The performances themselves are remarkable. The singing is unrewarding; he tells us repeatedly that he isn't really using his voice, that he is preparing to warm up, knowing that physical stress was coming. We don't notice it much because we know the songs so well, and what we hear has been supplemented dishonestly. But the dancing IS rewarding. The backup dancers are rewarding in the usual way; they are the best in the world, possibly — given advances in the science of training — the best ever assembled. Each time we see them, they are working hard as if their lives depended on it. In terms of narrative, the film is about them (and to a lesser extent the backup musicians). We see the tryouts, and the announcements of the winners. We see some truly extraordinary people here. This is where the energy comes from.Jackson's dancing is remarkable as well, but for different reasons. He reinvented stage dance. He is as influential as Astair, more because his visual style transformed music into a video art, a transitional metamedia where it stands today. We may be even more familiar with his moves than his sounds. He lopes through the numbers. It isn't fair to expect him to be good. His body is in pain; joints are taped up to allow even what we see.But what we see, even if it lacks energy, is amazing. Jackson is important because he created himself and everything about himself. Even his ideas about love and peace are fabricated. But the invention: face, clothes, music, pseudofamily and all are physically situated. He has created it all in the context of the space around him and how he moves in it. Even the iconic moonwalk where physics seems denied indicates this. It is remarkable not only because he invented a self, one that it is outrageous and comic in every detail, but that it is coherent and has an inner logic. That inner logic is spatial, a logic of movement. His soul invents itself first in movement and builds a self to occupy. This part alone makes the film amazing. Often in the film, we see numbers from beginning to end that are assembled from different rehearsals. In some of these rehearsals, it is clear that he has just arrived on the set that has been cooking for months. His stage choreography is made up on the spot. As the splices shift back and forth, you can see that each time, he is making up a different — sometimes wildly different — routine. He does so effortlessly. He does so automatically and with grace. But most remarkable is that it makes sense each time. It is a whole soul, coherent and true, visible. Visible to us, conveying that sense, that spatial logic.What an experience. It is sad that he had to suffer and die so this could come to us. If he had lived, he would have made a big show. As it is, we are allowed to see him in his own private show, living in movement, exposed.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw2150458"},{"movie":"This Film Is Not Yet Rated","heading":"Cupid's Thugs","date":"11 December 2007","content":"Its an artifact of the artistic pipeline that movies have to be packaged a certain way. They have to be so and so long, and have such and such narrative content, whether fiction or various kinds or documentary. We accept this as if somehow it is natural, just as we accept flat walls and square corners as natural to rooms instead of the manufacturing pipeline.This restricts filmmakers profoundly, because instead of discovering something and finding the right container for it, you start with the container and fill it. If you don't have enough stuff, you invent more.What we have here is film  a documentary  that has all sorts of extra, irrelevant stuff in it. It is restricted thus. Ironically, it is about how the industry and its manufacturing process restricts films.First the damage in the thing, then the damage it speaks of.There's an interesting case here. Its about how a small number of large powerful studios control the ratings system to make it difficult for independent and artistic filmmakers to market their films. It happens to be a secret process that is apparently biased and highly subjective. That's the story, how corporations stifle art. Its less about the arbitrariness of the process than that this dynamic exists.But that's not enough to fill a movie, or at least the way this filmmaker sees it. So he makes the fact that the reviewers are secret the centerpiece. Does it matter that its these controlled yaboos rather than another set? No, not really, but the mystery associated with the secret hijacks the picture. But even that isn't enough to fill the movie in this fellow's mind. So we get some kerfluffle about the chase, some business about detectives and stakeouts. But even that isn't enough, so we discover something of the life of our detectives, who happen to be lesbian housewives.All this is poured into the film because the form constrains. And this guy didn't see it coming. Michael Moore.But the point is a good one, the ten minutes he spends on it. We do get amazingly homogenous product. It is profoundly \"safe\" if you don't worry about fostering the most violent major society on the planet; if you are obsessed with sex and nudity; if you lose sleep about otherness. On the other hand, you need a large, restrictive inside in order to have an outside. Not all art has to come from the apparently deviant, I suppose, and its hardly enough. But it does seem to help.Here's a greater unintended feedback effect. Hollywood films thrive on a notion of romance that's puritanically pure. Its essential to the industry. That excludes depictions of relationships that are more like real life, that include hair, smell, sweat, amazing fluids and little deaths.

Depending on your vocabulary these are neurotics and psychotics; heads and hearts; numeralists and geometers; fatalists and cocreators and so on. Whatever terms you like to use, Gould is in the first of these, and that reflects his approach to music. Bach is also.Bach's music is highly mathematical, almost mechanically so. Stripped of emotion, it is pure in an abstract, cosmic sense. Gould's approach to music (and life -- not an incidental overlap) is neurotic, highly charged, anticipative, brilliantly logical, nimble. This mix -- together with a relatively more common virtuosity with the instrument -- makes Gould the best performer of Bach we have. His animation of the mathematics is always ahead of our own perception, so it makes the mathematics seem more alive. Not real life, but the kind of life we see in animated spheres.Contrast this with another world entirely, say Rubenstein (or Argerich!) and Chopin. This music is human, rooted not in some abstract aether, but in the soul. It is not clever, but real. It is not golden, but tearful, sweaty. It deals not with celestial mechanics, but with yearnings. Not with precision but with hesitations and local attractions. Not with planetary gravity but the emotional kind.Myself, I consider the latter to be true music, the life-altering kind. The former is brilliant decoration, also perhaps interesting technically. And that's the problem with this film: it emulates the Bach notion of little snapshot explorations. Each one is crafted to be technically brilliant; each one has some conceptual relationship with its neighbors. The sum triangulate the matter, giving a totality of external but abstract and distant probes.But the method lacks soul, and the subject here does too. We are intrigued by his eccentricities, but never invest in his being, because he doesn't have one in the musical sense. He has washed it away.For myself, I have to relegate this film to the huge stack of failed attempts to give us a film about music that has the same power, and type of power, as that music. It may be too hard an endeavor, but in this case the enterprise fails because the subject is in the wrong half of humanity.","id":"rw0330376"},{"movie":"Agatha Christie: 13 vid bordet","heading":"Suchet Sachet","date":"29 October 2009","content":"A new batch of old TeeVee Christie adaptations have become available on DVD. I've been marching through them valiantly, looking for anything of value. Here it is. This one is good.The story on which it is based is one of Christie's more interesting experiments in playing with the mystery form: moving the narrative structure from one untrusted device to another. These sorts of narrative folds are challenging for filmmakers, which is why I movie versions of Agatha sleight of hand.Here, the adapters did something clever in changing the whole focus of the story from the dinner in question to the surrounding lives of the actors (and the aristocrats, same thing). If you ignore the generally cheesy production values, you'll be faced with one of the best Christie film adaptations I know.But the real gem is Ustinov's Poirot. Now I know I am in the minority here, but I find his Poirot the most satisfying. Its a tricky thing, making these evaluations, but the reason why has to do with his relationship to the process of discovery. With Marple, the process is a matter of already knowing what needs to be known about why things occur. All she has to do is match the circumstances she finds with what patterns she has stored.Poirot is a different sort. He is engaged in a genuine battle with evil, an obsession which he camouflages as a way to address boredom. His method is closer to the Sherlock model, reasoning from cause; following paths and possibilities. When you travel with a real Poirot, you are always living in the future, many speculative futures mapped onto data from the past to extend cause. So the second murder in a Poirot mystery is always preventable, but for his openness to too many possibilities. He then punishes himself, resulting in his most characteristic personality traits.TeeVee has taken the detective in a different direction. The engagement in the mystery is simply to present a series of baffling scenes and then explain them at the end. Along the way, you have to be, well, \"entertained.\" So they create characters to do so. In the books, the humor was laid on top of the detective spine. Its because though Christie was a great plot designer, she was poor when it came to wordsmithery. She made up for this by creating engaging characters. The formula is reversed in TeeVee. That's why you have Suchet's Poirot, and Brett's Holmes. Their twitching and poking makes them amusing regardless of what happens around them. Ustinov creates a Poirot more in the spirit of one engaged with the narrative, and inspired by the drive to deduce.The bonus here is that his foil is on screen, Inspector Japp. Japp plays a different role in the detection than Holmes' Lestrade. He is competent, but limited in the ability to live in the future. He is, in fact, a junior Poirot. Here he is played by the very David Suchet who would become the much admired Poirot in a later series.

Plus, Costner annoys the heck out of me. But this film really works because it is relentless and because, well because it effectively captures an event which changed the world. I truly believe that no other two week period in the past half century has had as much societal effect.I was in 10th grade in the Norfolk Virginia area during this period. Our high school and homes were opened to the navy dependents evacuated from Gitmo. Their dads and ours were the eyeballs and fists employed in this enterprise. We were certain we would all die. We traveled with money and medical records sewn into our clothes in the event that we were instantly orphaned and survived in some horrible state.So much came out of what was distilled in this event. The hippy movement, both the peace part and the reckless drug part. The U2s flew out of `Area 51' and the military's obfuscating cover stories deliberately spawned a UFO culture that is still with us. So odd: a militarily manufactured counterculture.The strong desire to hit the Soviets was pushed back (twice!) by Kennedy's levelheadedness. But the military was later able to flummox Johnson into Vietnam. Lemay had been pushing a first strike for 14 years by then and had actually arranged to steal bombs from Sandia in 1950. That is why today the weapons are under Department of Energy control, supposed civilians.\nThe point is that the story is so central to our modern existence as people that it has a rich mine to exploit -- and it does, so very effectively. Watching this, one wonders first how we could have lost these two. And more to the point, how we could produce our current President Gomer. How do you think he will deal with situations like this?

You can start with images, or characters or situations. You have to choose the type of thread and how you trace it, including the key decision about who you are. These sisters take a different approach, very writerly, very clever. They start with the simple question of happiness in a life and come at it from multiple directions, surrounding and probing it. The characters are secondary to the writer's curiosity, and the 'stories' even more incidental. Sometimes you have a film that works with the viewer to grow a world and ideas; here you simply watch as ideas grown on a page are revealed to you. Quite different, precious, but never close to lifealtering or even viscerally engaging.The film itself superficially resembles a 'Short Cuts' or 'Things You Can Tell' in that many story lines are interwoven. But the differences are profound. Altman's projects are driven by characters and situations that touch because they ramble. The 'Things You Can Tell' project is similar to this one in that its several components are all about the same idea. But 'Things' uses the device of one woman in many bodies, each with a different actress. In this project, the device is deliberate diversity of the characters, each facet having a discernible face.I liked it. Its not highly cinematic, rather small theater. Its not the stuff that changes one's imagination. But it is literate, refined, and well woven in terms of the words.As to the actors and their roles, one thing all these multifaceted projects have is the option for the viewer to select a backbone. As a matter of hardwiring we reflexively choose one thread as foreground and the others as background. For me, the anchor was Beatrice, which probably tells you a lot about me. The resurrection from disillusionment (with the opening of the doll's eye!) was a bit heavy so far as the character, but DuVall as an actor really impressed me.

All those are deliberately stupid in the name of being artfully bad.But the house is remarkable.Since the beginning of film, directors have struggled with how to manage the camera in the context of space. Many types of solutions. Welles made the funhouse a character in `Lady from Shanghai.' One can see the influence of that, plus the library from `Ninth Gate' in this `house.' Polanski is the master of building-centric horror, so naturally he will be a source.But usually the solutions to space focus on turning the environment into a machine. Even the dreadful `Waterworld' had that marvelous trimaran.But the genre gets narrower when the machine is for supernatural purposes as in `Fifth Element' (on which the set designer worked), `Stargate' and so on. Just in the last few weeks, I have seen many films whose influence one can see melded here. Three influences: sliding walls, pits, orreries. The construction we have here is a pretty intelligent mix: a machine slides walls to manipulate the action of the theater. The inhabitants actions provide energy for the orrery-like mechanism. That mechanism centers on a pit.Examples:--- Sliding walls have a long tradition. Only a few examples come to mind other than Welles' funhouse. `The Cube'--- Also we have the influence of orreries. These were originally mechanical models of the heavenly bodies, which over time have come to represent control over heavenly forces. It's the same idea as the guy who can stop time by halting the movement of hands on a certain watch. Orreries are seen in `Dark Crystal,' `Hudson Hawk.' `Tomb Raider.' The version we have here uses counterrotating rings like the machine in `Contact.'-- The pit is the least interesting influence, something that is downplayed here. `Lair of the White Worm' is the purest example. `Mystery Men's' pit was cool too.I'd appreciate it if fans of the genre could send me more examples.","id":"rw0728479"},{"movie":"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead","heading":"Suicide Kings meets Goodfellows, worse than Either","date":"7 June 2001","content":"Spoilers herein.Some experiments from inexperienced writers and directors work.

Many conditions must coalesce, and only a few actors can rise to the challenge: Penn is the current master with PS Hoffman coming up.This film takes another, more elegant and though novel, more satisfying approach. Many good actresses are involved. The dimensions are separated into five threads which we are helped to rebraid through the careful efforts of those actresses.What we have is one prototypical character portrayed five different ways, by actresses that have radically different acting styles. Each focuses entirely on her own weaving, but it is clear that they are aware of the others. Hunter's mouth during the baglady's harangue deliberately quotes Close's during the tarot session. Hunter's stagger after the abortion has a couple steps in there from Close's demented mother. Flockhart's dying lover has some literally copied breaths taken from Hunter's abortion...No medium is quite like film. All art is a conversation between the artist and the recipient. But only in film is there an explicit party interjected -- the actor -- who can represent either the viewer, or the artist, or neither, or both (or themselves). In addition to the multidimensionality of the actors' roles, the writing here places the actors in shifting stances, shifting through all the choices listed. There is no self-reference; that would distract. everything is focused on me and Garcia, and the connection is manifold.And what focus! How close to the bones of womanhood can one get? How deeply into the mysteries of connection can one go? Connections between lovers of course, but the feminine nature of the connection that film can afford us between writer and our inner selves. Not since Polanski have I seen such sculptural direction with women. I wish we could see just what was the dialog between director and actress to coax such bare, clean performances.\nThe writing too. Screen writing is the hardest thing to do when you want to be true. You've got to be fake in just the right way to appear true. Flat truth always is fake. Only the most deft artifice can be true. Only the truly delicate writer can be deft with a woman's heart, which after all is the nexus of truth.

I miss the feeling of ease he allows.Some films are work. Some aren't worth it, while you do all sorts of conceptual shuffling to follow whatever structure the filmmaker designs. Or in the worst case which has not been consciously designed so needs to be mastered without help.But Altman doesn't create crystals with edges. He does not refract great truths. He simply observes. By this film, his technique of discovery is in full bloom. He never storyboarded or blocked a scene. He did not tell an actor where to go or look. He simply trusted the actors to inhabit their characters and trusted the camera to find them. The minimum was manufactured. This is dogma film-making before the oddly formed rigors of dogma were proposed to \"free\" cinema.What is remarkable about this film is not simply the flow of the images and narrative, but that of the sound. \"McCabe\" was, I think, his first serious work in understanding how sound can bleed. Later, he (and Malick) would explore other effective techniques of soundweaving. Here, we have a simple but very effective device. Most of the narrative comes not from what you see or are told. We hear the radio. We hear it when there is a radio turned on in the world we are watching. But we also hear it when our characters leave the world of repose and go do something. That something has a radio show — usually a crime drama — overlain. The immediate effect is that these guys are not robbing because they need money, or for some philosophical purpose. It is because it gives them identity, and that identity is defined here by radio. Just as the radio allows the imposition of identity on those we watch, the idea is that what we watch similarly imposes on us. Much of what we see the characters do is measure how effective their adoption of character is. \"Bonnie and Clyde\" was something notable among Hollywood films in 67. It advanced this notion a tiny bit, using a French film vocabulary. It will be hard to recognize that today because the French derived from Hollywood.

In the process, he permanently injures his arm. A woman in the audience soon gives him a job as bouncer in a club. He falls for the head hoochy girl, though both are swell folks.But the club owner lusts after the same girl, so he arranges for the brother of that very girl to frame our fighter for theft. He had to you see because he was caught stealing $1,000 himself. So our fighter goes to prison, but doesn't mind because his girl visits frequently.Meanwhile, the framing brother falls in love with the fighter's sister! He confesses to his sister and she determines to repay the $1,000 and get him off the hook. The fighter is released and thinks the girl is two-timing. That's fixed. So he arranges a fight for $1,000 if he simply goes three rounds with a famed bruiser. Naturally he gets pulverized, until thinking about his great girl, then he wins! On to the club where he pays off the bad boss and slugs him as well. Both couples bask in happiness.Worthy of Hemingway.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","id":"rw1029805"},{"movie":"They Nest","heading":"The Girl Among Dopes","date":"12 February 2007","content":"Supergenres are genres that are so mature that the story is so predictable that it becomes a wrapper for a story within, or a situation within that is the implicit focus. The enclosing supergenre here is a bug horror movie. Its formulaic as it should be. Ho hum. The situation within is a town populated dually with simple good folk, all extreme stereotypes denoted in the briefest of shorthands: the warm old woman who here is also the schoolmarm, in charge of the island's kids. The dumb old man who is borderline senile. The tough but honest town cop who by himself keeps the rest of the town in line. And that whole rest of the island? Well, they are 30 year old high school male dropouts, unemployed drunks with no sense whatever.Normally these guys would be associated with some Southern setting, Confederate flags and perhaps some indication of sexual deviance or inbreeding. But here they are in the rural north, a relocation that underscores the importance of the stereotype apart from place. It makes the fact that they are drunken dopes significant.In the midst of this is our woman, the whole point of this inner story. I'm interested in this because of all the actresses they could have chosen, the thousands upon thousands who could handle this slight part, they chose a specific type. They chose her because of how she looks  there can be no other reason. She's a redhead. She's a redhead of a specific type.I'm interested in narrative structure, patterns, templates and bits of the visual grammar we use to covey complex notions by reference. Women in film are the most complex when it comes to this but within women and film, redheads are the simplest case. So I have a serious study of redheads underway, and what they mean if terms of shorthand, and how that shorthand references folding.I think there are only a few slots for redheaded women. There's the freckled, sometimes almost pigtailed, puffylipped womanchild. There's the sexually powerful, tempestuous woman, sometimes self-destructive. She seems to be modeled on a sort or aristocratic face: significant forehead and eyes  and represented by women who know how to act with their upper face instead of the lower.And there's a sort of in between, the girl-next-door type who represents possibilities, who carries latent qualities of these extremes and others, but who is happy in the theatrical representation of simply being a representation.So, our character here is played by Kristen Dalton. Her qualities as an actress are that she has a pronounced chin and a magnificent, aristocratic bearing. She's learned to move with that chin  actually her mouth  as the center of gravity. She isn't a great actress but she does act with her eyes. In other words, she understands a redhead's place in film, and knows how to exploit it. Why do I focus on this one redheaded actress? Because Scorsese saw her (in this, I think) and cast her as Nicholson's girlfriend in his own movie about movies and acting, curiously titled unless you know his intent.So we will see a lot of Kristen, and we will see her BE red and tell us red.The key elements of the story here have her as essentially the only woman in a town of dopey rednecks. All are single of course. She holds her own, being the soul of the school, the chief merchant (you literally can't buy anything unless you find her), and the color at the docks, running a forklift.There's a big city doctor in the story but he's there only to notice her and draw her into the story. She circulates among the dopes.

This is another. I first saw it at an all night drive-in in 1971, with my wife and toddler son. It was the fifth and last movie on the bill.Of course, I've seen it many times since. Each time adds to the experience in some incremental way that cleverly avoids deficiencies. Like the best friendships, and similarly this comment will have bias.I'm an amateur student in reflexive film and literature: that's where the film is aware of its role as a fabricated reality. The best of these add some layers within, where the characters create in the same way that they were created. Most scholars believe this began with `Don Quixote.'\nThere is another equally novel literary tradition I particularly admire: the detective narrative. That's where the traditional role of storytelling is turned into a contest between writer and reader, each working to anticipate the ending in a way that - within certain rules - flummoxes the other. This actually started with Poe but was popularized in the Holmes stories which supplanted the clever character-based model of Dickens.Two revolutionary ways of engaging the viewer, both since exploited by clever filmmakers. Here, we have a clever synthesis of the two. And it involves an actor - possibly the best `old style' actor - who appreciates the challenges of separating actor and character.The treatment (like that of the muppet movie) is disguised as a simple comedy of endearing madness, along the lines of `Harvey.' But there are some amazing constructions here, including that early scene where a man will not speak because he exists in silent film character mode and needs to shifted to `reality' mode. There is a similar notion of shifting from reality to medium in the later sequence where a woman physically speaks to a telephone operator, then calls her. The catch-22 of this situation is just an excuse. The whole story is about looking for clues: shifting things from one reality to another by intervention of character/writer (who is really a judge/scholar). Home base is a library.The trigger for the story is a photograph. This film isn't seen by viewers as an intelligent construction because of its light hearted treatment, especially the slapstick supermarket sequence. This incidentally starts with a reference to `The Third Man' in the sewer kiosk which would never exist in New York.I believe that an art form of the future will be to go back to these underappreciated gems and reedit them, or embed them in another project. It makes sense to take a film about shifting layers and add more, Peter Greenaway-wise. The first thing to go would have to be the flippant sound track.Not convinced this had intelligence behind it? What happens at the end?This ending is so remarkable that I often go to that very spot when I visit New York, sweetly near the Alice in Wonderland, John Lennon and `the Tempest' memorials.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.","id":"rw0119640"},{"movie":"They Go Boom!","heading":"Queer Stuff","date":"31 December 2004","content":"These guys work in two modes.

Its because it doesn't matter. I will truly forget this film in the sense that none of it will change me, indirectly lead me somewhere or trick me into some discovery. In preparation for this, I saw \"Siberiade,\" another oildrilling epic where kinship is central and the drive to the earth is a retreat.(The \"blood\" in the title is associated with family, not weeping veins.)Elements of that Soviet film will stick with me forever, though the film has less explosive emotion. (It does have a far more dramatic oilrig fire  real instead of from ILM. And it has teasingly seductive songs, not the edgy, spineraising tension of here.)The one element that should have grabbed me was undeveloped. Here is a man who we see is broken. There are no events to follow. He becomes a success and remains broken. The only story for us to seek is why. We know he had peculiar feelings for his sister and left home traumatically. That he prefers isolation of the most remote kind. That given any opening for bond, for blood: HW, the discovered brother, the child Mary, he will grab it with both hands and look for disappointment.We know going in that the business of twins appeared only late, but it could have been central to this mystery of sucking and discarding both blood and oil.

She falls into three traps here, and we have to suffer with her.The first trap is one that has become a rather tiresome observation. Being very good at acting provides nearly no basis for being a competent filmmaker. Indeed, since the concerns are so different, it is often the case that in stepping over the line, an actor carries the wrong values and messes up the project. An actor is all about push, about delivery, about richness. The actor's job is to be powerful, effective even when subdued.The filmmaker's job is to take away, to sculpt the world of possibilities to give us a narrative that we can fondle. The filmmaker takes away much of what the actor gives, so that the actor can fit into a larger enterprise and be effective. Without that shaping we get 90 minutes of auditions.Hunt, like so many other actors, falls into this trap.But long before that she, or her sponsors, made a fatal error in thinking that they could get away with amateurish cinematography. She probably felt that the camera is only there to catch the actors, so art or craft was not especially required. Wrong. This is painful on the eyes.There is another problem as well. The source material isn't particularly novel or difficult. But it has a certain structure that makes it work. Its not a simple structure. It depends first on a notion of pain being required for happiness. This is purportedly a Jewish wisdom, and likely is common in the American post-holocaust culture. This is conveyed as the basic cosmology into which this adopted child (now an adult) finds herself.Then the story itself builds on the symmetries of belonging: she wants a child. Her mother who gave her up wants a child. There are two men in her life who represent aspects of childishness and who convey dialog about the nature of motherhood.This structure matters. Its what makes narrative work. Its is the skeleton of the shape that the filmmaker must sculpt around, using vision first.

While some of them are compelling by themselves, the combination sometimes eats itself.The main backbone of the thing is a production of \"Mother Courage\" put on recently in New York City. It features Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline and others, being a new translation with new songs. The play is a strange thing, highly theoretical in form and apparently difficult to present properly — meaning with the original, ironic intent. It is an anti-war presentation with a nuance usually not present in such things. The idea is that though it is the powerful who push war for profit, it is the \"little folks\" who truly enable it by compliance. A layer on top of that is essentially a documentary on the development of the production: rehearsals and such. It may have been the original intent of the filmmakers to have just these two threads, combined in the manner of \"Vanya on 42nd Street,\" where the politics and interaction of the production mirror and annotate the play.But we have all sorts of extra stuff slathered on top. We have some detailed, overly worshipful history of the play. Some is interesting, most is not.On top of that is a sort of biography of Brecht, the author. It is the full Ken Burns treatment, leveraging every photo, home movie and newsreel. To give you the flavor of this part, it even includes a dotted line on a map showing the progressive travels of the man. But oh no, we do not stop there. Brecht was influenced in a minor way by Marx, so we drag in a professor of Marxian thought and we hear him pontificate, sometimes to his classroom. Ultimately, after we hear personal assurances of this fellow's antiwar credentials, he admits to us that Marx has nothing to do with the play. But that's not before he...Gives us the standard antiwar pitch, complete with references to current conflicts, and footage through \"duck and cover,\" the Bimini blast and the holocaust. The tone of this section is the very thing the play is designed to undermine. The very thing! Not only that, but this fellow's personal journey through antiwar activity features a specific event that he participated in and is proud to show footage of. Well, as it happens, I was at that very event, right in the center of it all. It was one of several Vietnam protests at MIT, concerning labs that did work for the military. I do not recall it being much like he reports.You have to edit this yourself, taking out all the junk that Brecht would have had none of. You have to simply go back to the play, and Meryl's comments on her commitment. She is why it happened, and it is her intent that matters, not anyone else that circulates around her.

The joke here is the desecration of Shakespeare that the British stage has foisted on us in the last century: the conceit that he is all about actors instead of something larger. it quite literally murders what it means to be human. The silent movie scenes in the beginning underscore that this understanding is the basis of the film: Shakespeare bereft of even the words. The first scene after that is the film proper: a shot of a van with the words: `Shakespeare's Removers.' The audience consists of something identified as `meths drinker' (a Britishism that I assume means a drinker of methanol).

After all, we readily accept equally offensive manipulations in modern movies. And this one at least has high production values overall compared contemporary films. Its just a matter of style. What we considered values back then simply don't resonate today except as a yearned for ideal in some sectors. (I refer to when the film was made, not the period in which it is set.)So a comment on this film is essentially a comment on the values therein and how artfully they are conveyed. They are conveyed pretty well, I'd say, excepting for Peck. This was before he decided to simply be one character because his range is poor. Here he tries an accent and a being so foreign to him and unrealistic, he can't make it. Later, with \"Mockingbird,\" he solved that problem, but here he's high school. Its so distracting that  knowing his later history, and the irrelevance of the kid  one could easily thing that the yearling is Peck.There's an artificiality to the story that rankles. Would a couple in stress, who are near starvation, who have lost at least four children, some presumably from malnutrition... who are desperate. Would they allow a pet to repeatedly threaten their lives? This is a man in the story who is facing almost certain death if he goes to retrieve stolen pigs, but must.

I've liked him from the first I've seen of him, \"Picnic at Hanging Rock.\" Original and haunting.What he did there, he has done less powerfully and more conventionally, but it comes from a religion that I respect.You see, you have choices about how you believe the world works. It doesn't even have to be the real world, because the worlds of narrative can be bigger, with cleaner more explicit dynamics. Weir's world is one in which the world drives the narrative and people just exist in it, more or less successfully. This is not a common world in film, what with the Italian character-centric, the Spanish fold-centric, and the overwhelming noir-centric models out there.He's done some crap, some commercial crap, but he's largely stuck to his notion of the world that grinds on independent of will. This is, after \"Picnic\" his most atmospheric, and surely the one with the most exotic world movement. So its admirable on those scores, that it represents a rare cinematic religion, and that it does so with effective exotic authenticity.But there is something creepy about this. Its by an Australian company. Aussies are an interesting people, largely European in origin but deliberately fresh in perspective. There's much made here about Gibson's character being fundamentally different (he thinks) from the stodgy imperial British military guy. Gibson quite literally steals the girl from this guy because of his Australianness. \"The girl\" here represents so much more than a single person coupling, and expansion that Weir's world allows. It isn't sex, but the seduction for control over the story.(He, incidentally is a story-writer.)But what's smarmy about this are the limits of Weir's own imperialism. True, he reports on the grinding conditions. True, he has a main character preachify about the nobility of helping in the small. But at the end, an unintendedly horrible, unsettling end, all the white folks simply leave safely. That by itself is okay, but the way it is celebrated as a victory, the victory of the couple, subordinates the chaos of the world to backdrop.Now, if this were a more intelligent filmmaker, I would say that this was intended. A clever artist would use this device to trick us into being the imperialists and releasing it too late. But I think the truth here is more unsettling: he didn't see it at all.I write this a few days after Australia threw out its thuggish administration, George Bush types who similarly couldn't see.

I started with an interest in exploring how directors deal with the uniqueness of their vision, especially when self-aware or self-referential. (Self-aware is when the film shows how it is made, like the obvious effects in `Beetlejuice.' Self-referential is when the film comments on itself, like when the story is about a filmmaker (or writer) who is worried about a technique that one can see in the film.)Over time, I've become aware of what some directors call the actor problem. The public thinks of films first in terms of the people they see, the actors. And those actors drive the business. The problem is that actors have somewhat different goals than filmmakers, and often a strong actor will ruin the effect intended by a gifted director.So I've been studying the various techniques and instances where each party succeeds in a solution that works. They are few, it seems.Here is the ultimate solution: invent the actors. Shucks, invent their whole world. Invent their reason to be. Walt Disney shocked the whole system when he first did this. He created the actor, but not their world: Micky and later Donald and the others belong more or less in the ordinary world. However, the roadrunner and coyote belong in different world, one where the emotional physics comes from the mind of the filmmaker. We come to know just how that world works. Both the actors and their world come from a single mind.Now with claymation comes a particularly unique development: the actor is created, the world is created. But the camera and lighting is `real,' and modern notions of camera movement are used, just as in a `real' film. The technique is self-aware: one can see that the characters are clay, see the thumbprints.And it works, largely because one man's mind can be coherently presented in the context of real movies.`The Wrong Trousers' is the peak of this man's mind though. The first film was better in the sense of literally exploring the possibilities of another world and its physics. The claycraft was more primitive and appealing, but the story was weak and the actors hadn't really learned how to use their faces.The film after this `Shave,' necessarily involved many collaborators, which diluted the vision. And more people meant more costs which means lowered risks which means vanilla story. That ultimately led to the slightly clever but wholly mainstream `Chicken Run.'So this film is a peak of sorts. A couple things make it uniquely fine: the strong self-reference and the cinematic expression.The `Wallace' world is fully Hitchcockian here, moreso than before or after. Hitch's innovation was to advance the drama by making the camera act, in subliminal but powerful ways. Nick has studied and mastered this -- it is the real power of `trousers.' The technique is as much a matter of the camera humor as anything else.And the story is self-referential as well: the basic problem of the filmmaker is that each film cements the future of films that follow. There is a straitjacket of expectations from the viewer that you cannot escape. One example: if you have a spaceship battle, it must rumble and flash like the movies before or it will not seem real, though the actual behavior of such a battle could never really appear so.All film -- down to the smallest detail -- is so constrained. It is something deeper than formula.In his natural state, Wallace's `clothing' is unconstrained, only the manner in which he has to put it on. So here we have Wallace dressed by mechanical means. That's the normal state, Nick and Wallace tinker with those mechanics to have fun.But now comes the real challenge: how to put Wallace in a fully Hitchcock world with all the plot formula that entails. It is mostly mechanical, that. Well, in a self-referential way, you put Wallace in some automatic, mechanical pants, that literally walk him through the plot, that literally drag him through all the stuff you need to have a `real' Hitchcock film. It's a brilliant notion, one that ranks as the most successful in the history of film.But Nick is already creatively worn out or more likely compromised by the system.

But he  in all his films goes simply for a story that allows for the establishment of a tone and then he simply hammers the daylights out of it.There's something worth arguing about though. He has this technique of anchoring the camera to his character, often by a tether. It is front, following, side, always with the body. Our Italian American filmmakers do something like this, except not so precise and consistent. It is from a specific philosophy of storytelling that has people defining the cosmos. I wonder how possible it is to make a successful, textured film with this approach. There simply cannot be enough flavor, sunshine, penetration in the mix.

There are still remnants of the Dickensian model where peculiar characters shape the world. Mister Fairlie here, an absurdly nervous effete and his meek assistant are from that model. The intrigue as well: a family fortune complexly entailed.But the notion of an outside observer who is on screen, structuring the narrative from observations we share is new. Our \"detective\" is a professional observer, a painter. This profession was the closest that then existed to the qualities we need.What we would now consider part of the detective duties -- being an on screen observer in addition to sensemaker -- is shared by the love of the painter. Here the role is played by a heartbreakingly lovely earnest actress. The stock is black and white but we know she is redheaded.Cinematically, they have missed the opportunity to leverage the process of logical assembly that goes on in the mind of the artist. That would have been profoundly cinematic. The specific inadequacy of this film is what inspired Greenaway with \"Draughtsman\" which you might watch with this.The cinematic carrying is done here by Greenstreet. His device is that he has the ability to hypnotize. It is women-only and apparently intuitive. The filmmaker does well enough with this.You won't find this to be a very good film. But it is an accurate enough version of the book.

Of the ones that are not, they still can be fun. This project made money when it was new, but is now not only unengaging but repulsive. Why is actually engaging, because it just cannot be explained by fading fashions.There is plenty of that: smoking, TWA, pretty airline \"stewardesses,\" gay jokes, the implication that an \"airline pilot\" is both a status job and that they are tough. A gun joke. Below that is a notion of sexuality, manhood and marriage that is at least unfashionable, and noticeably as bankrupt as the currently marketed ones. It had all the attention that a success needs: two then popular movie comics, production values, songs by two of the then biggest pop stars... a script that was already proved as a success in France and (brief) full frontal nudity. So why did this age so poorly? I think it is because it was not good in the first place and viewers did not notice. Contrast this with \"The Hangover,\" which banks on equally inept but currently fashionable notions in those areas. It is, however, completely novel, well constructed and essentially cinematic.

The story has nothing at all to do with the traditional detection of Holmes and in fact he acts like a regular film detective of the era. In other words, he simply places himself in danger and solves the crime that way.There are two notable things along the way in this disaster.The first is the introduction of mesmerism as the agency by which the evil professor performs his villainy. One wonders that if he could control his subjects so well, why not just tell them to bring all their money instead of concocting such a risky and costly plot? But never mind, the idea of hypnotism is a standby. It had appeared in \"Caligari\" and would again soon in \"Manchuran Candidate.\" Here it is merely something to take up time between the tired beginning and the dreary end.The real great little piece is a meeting between Moriarty and Holmes. Watson is held while Moriarty comes to visit Holmes once it is known that Holmes is on the case. If Holmes was the detective he was in the earlier films, he would have already been on the case instead of having to be asked. In any case, he anticipates that Moriarty will appear, and when he does the conversation is something like \"You already know what I am about to ask\"You already know my answer\"Is that final?It is a few moments of the Holmes as he originally was written, a man who plays mental chess, who would die without a worthy adversary or problem. Its only a few moments, and acted poorly. But they sure are memorable.

It is a Marvel production and that means the world is dull in all aspects. They seem incapable of leaving safe territory, so this is more or less Michael Bay in the nineties.But there is something interesting going on. The way these films are put together, I believe, is as a set of manufactured stereotypes for the world market. You can't just target the US any more. Of course you still have to have a baseline of American grit, with the structure of a Western. And you have to honk around with roles of women. Those are essential for this recipe. What's interesting to me is the way the Japanese are handled. Japanese culture as filtered through film is a more powerful influence I think than even Europe minus Italians. Italian storytelling stands apart in film, and the influence is strong.But not as strong as Ozu and Kurosawa. Heck, Japanese film makers even did French new wave better. So when a film wants to leave the underground of who invented what in the cinematic vocabulary and just shuffle stereotypes, but from the same world, it folds into something novel.Our guy on the other side is a somewhat noble officer at a POW camp. Saved from The Bomb, he turns on his savior because he wants the technology in his soul. One of the world's richest technology companies was created by this guy, but instead of the American Tony Stark model, he can only implement ideas from others. The genius in the picture is a Western woman, incidentally evil in ordinary ways, who is hired by our Japanese mogul.Part of the stereotyping is that nothing is settled on the western side. Our hero hates his life of constant pain and remorse. Our western evil woman knows she is absolutely evil. But shift to the corrupt Japanese politician, the organized crime hoards, the Japanese boss, the rejected boyfriend... All these live in a world in which their actions are proper.","id":"rw2986742"},{"movie":"The Wold Shadow","heading":"Lost Wold","date":"26 February 2006","content":"I suppose every film student in the world for the past 40, perhaps 50 years has had to endure Brakhage, sitting through whatever of his filmed essays the professor thinks he can speak to.So, as a matter of simply measuring success, he has achieved.Its an odd thing, how films get leverage. \"1984\" (in all versions) as a film will have a life for generations not because it is a good film, or book, but because it fills a market need for packaged insights of a clean and trivial enough nature to fit industrialized education.Theatrical success often hinges on one hook or another, and it is worthwhile knowing what works if for no other reason than realizing how you are being manipulated. It's usually about narrative in some form.In Brakhage's case, the narrative is external to the actual film, instead in his essays. These may not directly be exposed to a student, instead filtered through the saliva of the teacher only slightly modified. Its an odd phenomenon, that art is supposed to be deep, boundless, challenging and lifealtering, but ideas about art must be the opposite: succinct, closed, comprehensible, easily conveyed. Even that observation is one of the acceptable ones! So we have so-called \"experimental\" films, made as small lessons and sailed into a huge, fawning audience of (mostly) lazy academics.I could have picked any of his films for this observation: there are a few hundred and now a couple dozen on a Criterion DVD. I chose this because it is one of his most Pollack-like. I must admit that when I see these -- the ones that have no narrative pretension -- I think of them as dynamic paintings, as interesting experiences to prompt some thinking about optic impression.They are filmed, but not film for me. They are paintings, just as almost all of Gaudi's work is sculpture rather than architecture. A real film is architectural, you enter it and live in it, interacting with it in as many ways as you have grown tendrils. A painting is something you experience from a distance, the fog of space, separation being part of the experience.Brakhage cannot understand what movies are all about.

The very best experience is when you find two films that are imperfect by themselves, but when merged in one's mind become complete and powerful.This worked for me with `Maze' and `Immortality.' Both are about diseased, talented men who fall in love in an unwanted fashion. One involves birth, the other death. In perfect symmetry, one involves creative artifacts as art looking at bodies, the other art as actually being produced by bodies.One is a vampire movie. Vampire movies NEED redheads. The other film has the redhead, in almost irresistible, lovely, perfect openness. The vampire film eschews the compulsion and involuntary action usually found in the genre, where the other one embraces it.You really need to see both to see how perfectly these merge, how the impossibly sweet love of `Maze' fixes the problem with `Immortality' that the power of the love just isn't there. And similarly in `Maze,' the curse of the blood is always present, but never MEANS anything beyond a few comedic moments. Conflate the two and you have something constructed like Lynch's `Blue Velvet,' where darkness and light, love and curse, are played out as the battle between two film genres. `Velvet' had those two genres in the same film, but you as an intelligent viewer need not be so limited.You can even use the hooks each already provides: `Maze' shifts to shaky POV when the Tourette spasm strikes. Insert there, parts of `Immortality.' `Immortality,' on the other hand - following the French tradition - introduces the viewer (the policeman) into the story. He `creates' the vampire by watching: insert Lyle Maze's artistic process here, which in his home film is equated to the literal creation of a human (which is then introduced at an exhibit).Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw0477235"},{"movie":"Fallet Winslow","heading":"Layered Artifice","date":"8 October 2000","content":"Two interesting things about this film. Mamet usually overdelivers. But with his Vanya and this play, both adaptations, he explores subtle layering. What the layering concerns is the second point. But the fashion of the layering in this case is extreme understatement. One can see where Mamet is experimenting to see how far he can go, and that's not too enjoyable, since the mechanics of writing show. He was masterful with Vanya. Here, he tries too hard.But the point of the play is very fine. Here we have yet another film about acting. The event which gets the wheel turning is a young boy who lies about his guilt. (His guilt is never really in doubt as the overwhelming evidence is presented...Spoiler ahead! ...and he is acquitted in an OJ-like confabulation of legal tricks. This is why the British public was so upset.)But never mind that the boy is acting. Or that his father is pretending to believe in the family's honor. Or never mind the other minor Victorian deceits (that the maid pretends to not know of her impending dismissal, the black sheep son pretends to not despise his father, or that the soldier pretends to love his fiance.)No, this film is about the lawyer/lord. Jeremy Northam is perfect. He never believes in the boy's innocence. He is one artifice laid on top of another. He lies to his friend about a judgeship knowing the confidence will be shared with the woman he is toying with. His entire behavior in chambers and the house is an act. The last scene which is superficially lovely is actually an escalation of the artifice.Northam pulls this off well. He lets us know at root he is Northam the actor, playing Mamet's lord, who is an elaboration of the original play's character, who in turn represented a very real person. But because that person was a Victorian, he himself was false. As with Vanya, the point of the play is to allow the actor to weave in and out of these layers. Northam is perfect, I say again.One cannot get so excited about the female foil. When will directors ever learn not to direct the people they sleep with? She smiles well. How vapid in comparison to Northam's locomotive.","id":"rw0552706"},{"movie":"Duvans vingslag","heading":"In Love with the Memory","date":"24 June 2000","content":"There are two tests in my mind for a classic film.First, it must plant some images permanently in your life. Very few films do that. Two films that are cogent to discussing this one are Helena Bonham Carter's Ophelia in Zefferelli's `Hamlet.' She and Glenn Close acted circles around the guys -- her expression in the midst of the play within the play is lasting over years in my memory. The whole film revolves around that moment.Also lasting are several images from the ostensibly unambitious `Oscar and Lucinda.' But I also carry many lasting film images that are junk, courtesy of Lucas and Spielberg. That brings us to the second condition: for a film to be classic, evocation of the images, the remembrance, needs to be multidimensional, to elevate rather than dumb down.Measured by those rules, this film is remarkable. For a few years, I have carried the image of the next to last scene where Carter makes love and in the act discovers the truth about her love. This is so wonderful, so tragic, so true that it has stuck with me, together with the secondary images, the memories of Venice and Millie that Merton is in love with. I hope to follow this woman's career for decades. I wonder where it will go?","id":"rw0441034"},{"movie":"Vild ungdom","heading":"Internally Not Wild at All","date":"17 November 2002","content":"Spoilers herein.There's a lot to say about the confused stance of this film, reflecting a distinct dissonance in the American psyche: it begins with an imposed `warning,' and tries to straddle the line between celebrating passion and condemning weakness. But I'm more interested in Brando.He had already revolutionized film forever in just one outing, and would go on to do some very clever things. Along the way, he considers himself a lose collection of parts contained in a single skin. Each part can approach the role differently and by engineering the differences he projects the supertheatric. Each of his parts operates independently and some take over parts of his body. Here, one of his star `component' performers is his butt. It is already showing plumpness, a matter which vexed Brando at the time.But all in all, he manages something unknown at the time and rare since: a jazz performance among the various components of himself. Everything else (story, the actors, the situation) is simple traffic. Everything you see the characters do, Brando has his internal gang do, including the split of half the parts into a semi-competing gang. Including the homoerotic overtones.Some cheezy backprojection and obvious stuntdoubles mar the production as much as the cold war preaching. Some believe that the icons in this film invented or accelerated some societal trends, and that may be true. But it is because the player alone gave it power.History note: there's some credible speculation that this film supplied the inspiration to John Lennon in naming his band, the `Beatles' as the splinter rebel half of an already rebel `organization,' rock and roll.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw0053995"},{"movie":"Det vilda gänget","heading":"The Woman's String","date":"23 September 2007","content":"By this time, westerns had become a collection of icons, the mere flash of which evoked deep memories and stories. All you needed was some confidence, the skill all in the confidence. There's a selfreferential aspect to the hero we'd often see, as he would himself be a paragon of confidence in delivering our referenced vision.This was thought to turn that on its head by having the avatar we share with the filmmaker be a bad guy. \"Bonnie and Clyde\" had played a similar game the year before, and in a genre with a similar mechanism. But the gangster picture was less richly iconic, the vocabulary relatively small, closed. \"Butch Cassady\" would come a few months later and turn the western into a refection of the present instead of past, foundation stories  folding the \"gang\" into Sergeant Pepper. So when I watch this again, I do so looking at icons and watching how they've been tampered with. This comment addresses two.One is the women. I seem to remember criticism at the time that this was misogynist, though its hard to see how it could have been deemed worse than its predecessors. Its mighty hard to beat \"The Quiet Man\" where John Wayne, after serial episodes of recreational drunken fighting, drags his selected but reluctant sweetie by the hair through cow pies.In \"Wild Bunch,\" the woman trigger everything. A woman is behind the chief crook's motivation, her death also causing a physical wound that haunts him. Another woman, the Mexican's girl friend, runs away with the murderer of his father. The encounter with her is what everything revolves around. A third woman, a presumably permanently alluring prostitute, is what causes the two best friends to be separated before the movie begins and one friend to hunt the other. Oh, there are armies and robberies and shootings, but these are embodiments of womenly encounters. It matters because by this time noir had permeated everything but the western. The only way to introduce it was obliquely, through a force that's offscreen, that western notion of romance that exists only at the demigod level.The second thing to look for is the key shot, the one scene around which everything is built. The one shot that it is in the filmmaker's mind as he first wakes up and remembers the work. Sometimes the filmmaker tells you what it is. You may be fooled into thinking it is the shot in the beginning where scorpions are tortured by children. For me it comes 43 minutes into the director's cut. There are two outlaws in the gang that are also outlaws within the gang, more bad than the others. They are with a Mexican girl, a teen, and quite pretty. She is working a cat's cradle. If you don't know it, its a string game played with a loop by on or two pairs of hands. Its quite ancient and probably evolved alongside the development of spoken language. Its really quite hardwired in our brains and a solid model of cinemagraphic qualities can be built and shared using this \"string figures\" notation. Their encounter with this pre-sexual woman and this graphical node is the anchor shot for me. Your's will be different of course because each of us  I hope  builds the world differently.

Viewers often cite the 30s or forties as the best example, but for my money that honor belongs to many projects in the early seventies, attempting to recall the already dying ethos of the late sixties. I'm browsing through a number of these right now. Many never made it big because they tried so hard to evoke the feel of the time. This is a great example. It is set on an island so as be more abstract, and it casts the societal difference in an oddly stark metaphor: religion. Through this we have two incongruous threads: some reference to promiscuity which we are meant to see as linked to the paganism. Well, it _was_ linked to what the paganism stands for in the movie, but the connection is too thin. For instance, in one episode, our hapless detective (who is at a loss to understand what it is going on) stumbles on a woman in a bath. Her pose is stylized as if to say: movie nudity here. The heavy lifting in this department is by Ms. Britt, whose scenes are similarly artificial, not linked to anything we see, just stuff that we evoke from the 60s.The second odd thread is the twist at the end, which is both clever and cinematic.

About halfway through you understand why: an obsessed man made a flying balloon, mostly by making stuff up and killed his cinematographer. Now he wants to do it again, in a more dangerous location and Herzog wants to be the replacement cinematographer. Once in the jungle, we watch Herzog wangle to be on the maiden flight, clearly hoping for a disaster to film. He gets one: not fatal. It is hardly interesting, and the tortured scientist who supposedly is the center of thing is bore.Herzog's beautiful cinematography annotated by his profound gift of matching dreamy music to images turns even this mundane adventure into a spectacle, a thing of beauty. It is clearly not enough for him, so the man goes off in search of other beauty, and finds it in the face of a local man, \"Red Beard.\" He's a Rastafarian, who we first see completely wasted; in that state he names the airship \"the white diamond.\" We meet him, his medicinal plants, his beloved rooster and his dancing buddy. But the main character is an amazing waterfall, one in scope beyond my imagination for such a thing. We see this thing, this thing of wonder. It may be that no one but a practiced German can see mountains this way and convey majesty so powerfully. He sends a colleague down on a rope to examine the never-before-seen caves behind the falls. They are filmed, buy Herzog refuses to show it to us, because Red Beard, in his first appearance in the thing tells us that the caves are a holy mystery and showing them would ruin the nature of the place.From that moment on, Herzog complies and enters the simple world of amazed appreciation of this man. It is something he has done many times before. The result is that the images build and accrete. The crackpot guy gets to fly; his thing works, sorta. But that hardly matters by the end because we have the two men: Herzog and flyboy, belly down looking over a sharp cliff down the throat of the waterfall. They talk about the million swifts that live in the caves behind the falls. Then we get the payoff: we see those birds returning to their roost.Everything builds to this image. We have the camera at its perch, stationary, looking down. There is a quarter mile difference between groundlevels because one side of the earth is flowing skyward. In geological time, it remains for only an instant to allow us to place an eye, but for us, we cannot see the movement. There is the flow of the water, just as powerful, fighting the flow of the earth. They really did a good job on this, including a few earlier segments which showed its power. In one, a barechested German adventurer is lowered to make the film-never-to-be-shown, and we see the scale of things.And now we have the swifts. First we see them peppering the sky breathing in waves, but soon we look again down the waterfall and watch a million birds return to their still-secret roosts. They flow for ever so long, a stream of life woven into the two other streams. This image will stick to you for as long as you live, and I say that as someone who has seen something like this in life.

This comment is filed for the series as a whole, though I understand that the qualities I liked in these fifth and sixth season episodes are not characteristic of the first three years.I saw this on DVD so was able to avoid those distracting ads.What I liked about this was the way they learned to pace the thing. First of all, every arc is snappy, from the rushed one-liners to the resolution of some national or international crisis. But the nesting of the arcs is really worth noticing. There are the 40-70 second episodes, the tiny minidramas that often consist of dialog on the run. There are the episodic divisions of think five per episode that produce a chapter between commercials. There is that situation, the crisis that the episode addresses. There is the overarching soap opera of the characters that spans episodes. And the whole thing is nested within ordinary desires to explain the world politically. We have an undying need to do this, to have a coherent political story, so to nest in these ways fills that need with entertainment which many viewers I am sure will code as enlightenment.

Usually, one level creates or influences the other, and in that case the agent is a writer or filmmaker or photographer. The gold standard in my book is \"French Lieutenant's Woman.\" Probably the most folded is \" Saragossa Manuscript.\"  Or, you can have it the other way with a ghost from the other layer meddling across dimensions. I have hundreds of different versions of these in my database.Ms Bigelow tries something very ambitious here: she has two pulls on one layer: both the writer and photographer, both creating the world of each other at the same time they examine (and co-create?) the past. At the same time, she has the ghost from the past reaching forward, also through the written word. Also through sex.To do things like this, you need \"folded\" actors, actors that can perform on two levels simultaneously. She selected two that are famous for this ability: Sean Penn who without doubt is our finest living folded actor, and Sarah Polley who is the best female upcomer in this tradition. (Kate, Cate and Julianne are the senior members of that guild.)But to pull this off, is to \"pull on pulls,\" and requires someone whose insight and artistry can earn the place at the top of the pyramid. Bigelow is smart enough to know where that place is. This at once puts her in an elite group -- but she is incapable of the climb. Penn and Polley are lost.

As with all service businesses, she must chase the dollars created by real wealth, so she is cast in the position of facilitating the acquisition of health care by manufacturing.

This is another movie where the watching is itself not rewarding; the reward is in the awareness of sharing the experience of a risky, somewhat twisted experience. What we have here are cowboys and ninjas or more precisely the fully overloaded genres because the genre itself is not the target but the genres which twist the base. On that score it is mildly amusing, along the lines of \"The Quick and the Dead.\" But when you play this game, the only tools you have are peculiar juxtaposition and exaggeration. What makes this more interesting are the three catalytic devices that are used. Their selection and use is intriguing. On the character end, the girl here is not from the western genre at all, but a specific franchise that currently has more power. She plays Jessie from Toy Story, a cartoon of a cartoon of a cartoon. Because she has to also juxtapose and exaggerate, she is made into a scruffy redhead and her tomboy strengths are pulled first toward comic inadequacy and then revenge-fueled power. Jessie the Cowgirl meets Deborah Kerr meets Zoe Lund. On the situation side we have the very creative insertion of clowns. They are there for no essential story reason and indeed the plot hardly even explains them. But they are essential for the fusion, giving us an established background foundation. The two genres are not merely combined: they are both imposed on a constipated circus. The final device is purely cinematic. Since the environments are purely greenscreen fabrications they can be anything you can imagine. What was imagined here was crisp buildings in a gauzy, dreamlike landscape.

It is the strangest kind of documentary, a dramatization of what might happen instead of a report on what has. And although it was scary enough to be buried for two decades, it actually understates the disruption a war would have caused.And still could. In fact, this little film could be called an awareness exercise to prompt readiness. Since most analysts consider an Islamic terrorist bomb against a western city a near certainty, perhaps we need a modern version of this.It is a collection of extrapolations based on past wars and placed in Britain should the Russians choose to attack. Some scary facts about NATO's announced \"first use\" policy are given: If any invasion occurred, NATO would use tactical nukes to offset Russian numerical superiority. Knowing this (and the fact that their missiles are vulnerable liquid-fueled models) the Russians are likely to preempt over any scenario likely to lead to war.The damage from the actual attack is muted, instead focusing on the confusion afterwards for the unhappy survivors. I suppose the torture of the living is scarier business, at least in film. So we have lots of begrimed but healthy looking actors talking about their various miseries.Funny, I thought this valuable propaganda, where its sibling \"Threads\" was simple religious posturing.

That's the only way you can get some value out of it: by similar allowance. Normally I wouldn't say it would be worthwhile except for an added dimension in this case: The thing is written and the performance is held together by a man for his son, at least I think it is his son. The son takes the project as a play and delivers it to us as a film. So the more inadequate it is as a film compared to the writing, the more it makes its point. This is the sort of thing I specialize in, art that is what it expresses. I call this folding.The situation is simple enough: a collection of teachers in a high school. Students largely unseen as if they were crowding the scenes but insignificant. Among these teachers is the theatrically named \"Shamrock\" McShane as \"the bald guy.\" He's the writer of the thing, our surrogate witness and the holder of the eye that manages the mix of angst, frustration and mystic touch we see. There are some other teachers as well, but they are designed as blatherers, alternately in proud teaching stance, complaining crawl or emotional bafflement. A web search reveals that all these actors have some professional standing, and you can sense that they could be directed to be effective. None of them seem to know that film acting is fundamentally different, that motion matters. That spatial anchors exist. The direction seems to be simply a matter of placing the camcorder. You learn early in the game (but by research, not through the film itself) that the only student you see is the kid making the film.So its a strange thing. An adolescent, simplistic, inadequate, callow presentation of his dad's structured drama about the frustrations of pulling kids out of that very same state. There's some business about violence associated with the disconnect. I didn't see the tendons of how it all was supposed to be connected, and this will frustrate the viewer, especially if that viewer knows \"Brick\" which has much the same sense of distance from the classroom and similar tethers.As with several films I report on, this is simply a poorly made, thin film that would otherwise be worthless.

All is invested in the twin narratives of voice over and story-by-image rather than theater conventions.What a voiceover! By the strong Ribisi. What images! This may confuse some who expect there to be a plot, to have action and explanations. None of that here. Nothing is explained and it is somewhat questionable what happens.That's because Ms Coppola builds her narrative around Cecelia's diary. We see everything through a haze. Along the way, we encounter numerous unreliable witnesses. The psychiatrist -- strong here --  is DeVito who made a comedy of `Pale Fire,' for chrissakes (`Throw Momma from the Train'). The lover, who testifies, is institutionalized. TV reporters give twisted reports. The parents dissemble.Presumably DeVito advised on the Nabokovizing of the narrative, so that we cannot know if the remembrance is true. (The `Lolita' references are continuous, including the casting of Dominique Swain's (`Lolita') sister as Bonnie.) It is, therefore, all about collecting photos from the trash and weaving a story around misty remembrances and fantasies (the nightly trysts on the roof). It works not because it rings true, but because its falseness rings true.There's lots of moving back and forth in time and imagination, all done cinematically.

Intelligent cinema isn't part of this precis, nor is compelling drama (whatever that means), and in cases like this, even effective history.That's still okay with me in theory, because a key thing I look for is getting lost in the shape of the thing. The problem with Masterpiece is that lushness to them means good enough in all categories except sets and costumes. Nothing else is supposed to exceed the norm, apparently in a deliberate strategy to not overwhelm the visuals. This isn't Zeffireli's notion that you create a lush place and then occupy it with the camera, moving and discovering.No, this is simply a buffet table of color and texture and we are suppose to help ourselves. The \"story\" isn't integrated in, its just an excuse: royalty, richness, assumed importance. So I have to warn most of my readers off of this; its offensive in a way, mere artifice, not a real film.As history, it fails down a bit too. Too bad, because this is the period when English was born and became the worlds largest (in terms of words) and most flexible language. It was in large part a deliberate plan by Elizabeth (and apparently Burleigh). And it was the era where the Catholic Church, surely an evil institution then, had its back broken by the notion of enlightenment  the very idea of knowledge.And it was when the decision was made (mixed with wealthseeking) to colonize the New World with the new notion of discovering the \"magic\" therein, which happened to be a cosmos not centered on the Jesus of church dogma. So there's lots in this period to be mined. John Dee appears in only one scene, Harriot not at all. You have to make the story simple it seems, so we have essentially a love story, two actually, the second being someone credibly suspected as her son.Seeing things like this help you understand just why you come to films.

There are at least two false leads until we realize that we are being toyed with.This film is centered on Mike Binder's character.

Costner brings up a woman in the show, and everything follows from that, including and entanglement with a daughter.Another fold: one daughter is a performer, another a producer (aspiring at first) another a producer literally.

(I'm told that Connery's natural Scots accent makes him completely goof the intended Irish.) Deniro hadn't begun his slide into laziness yet. The score is apt as well.Still, to appreciate this you have to ignore all that, even though it is good enough, and focus on what is excellent -- how the camera moves within the frame. It is not De Palma's best in my mind: `Snake Eyes' is the film that shows his talent most purely. But this is great filmmaking cinematically. Every shot has motion in the camera; often smooth movement that perfectly complements the movement seen. De Palma is the true son of Hitchcock -- Hitch's camera ballet was a major component of the story: who can forget for instance the goodbye Babs shot down the stairs and out the door in `Frenzy.'De Palma's camera is less bound than Hitch's. It swoops and turns and explores and navigates without gravity which always informed Hitch's eye.

Perhaps all genres go through a life cycle and eventually fade away, or so most observers believe. But I think there was a more fundamental shift at work, a shift in how we see film stories. Musicals demand that we enter a work that wavers between reality (in the story) and a stylized non-reality where a song-and-dance theatrical entertainment is presented. Since the 60s, we've been unwilling to shift realities without one of the explicit conventions that have evolved, some quite sophisticated.They tried something like one of these conventions by having an onstage \"band\" whenever Christmas and gang appeared.But there are other interesting things about this project. First, that it really is rooted in reality, more so than others of its ilk. At least Molly Brown did live, and her life was roughly as depicted. Second, there was another fold with reality: a celebrity scandal involving the \"good\" Debbie and the \"bad\" Liz, with Debbie fighting back (as a pudgy 32 year old).But there's another level that is lost today. The 60's in particular and the decades before as well were periods when the American social conscience was in a \"populist\" camp. Movies and books reflected this: the rich were either evil, or selfish, or blind or simply stupid while the real wisdom and joy and meaning of America was found in its \"ordinary\" people.Many were the dramas that reduced things as they are here: genuine but rough, simple people contrasted with the stodgy, sober unimaginative rich. That was before the American scene shifted. Most people now consider themselves middle class and don't mind being a bit pretentious consumption-wise. What was \"simple\" and \"genuine\" has been co-opted by their commercial abstractions in various worlds (\"country\" and \"hiphop\" for example).The model for \"Molly\" has now shifted to the explicitly dumb but well-intentioned and pure- hearted as in \"Legally Blond.\"Once again, we have a Technicolor redheaded heroine.

The book was steeped in Eastern Europeanisms, an intimate linkage of interlocking clockworks: political, artistic, erotic. The book is highly introspective: lot's of glosses into selfaware annotations on itself. Sabina's art (and the fabric of the place), Tereza's photographs (and the films of the invasion) are merely the keystones for promiscuous philosophy.The sexual promiscuity is only the landscape for these explorations. But here, the manifold is linearized. It really is about sex in the context of power. All the meandering philosophizing is strained out. In its place are very serious efforts to _look_ Czech. It is a thin substitute.We have many (many!) of the best actors in the world in the traditional, non-ironic, non-layered tradition. So the thing is transformed into something, well more kitsch.

After a few dozen films, it must feel just like putting on a remotely controlled suit and doing the minstrel machine bit.I think it is possible to incorporate this in a film in a clever self-referential way. `The Wrong Trousers` is the very best of this, and pokes fun at the automatic nature of the Hitchcock formula.This about as far from that gentle sophistication as one can get. It is crude and stupid.But yet, this Ms Hewitt is pretty good at mugging over the camp. I don't know her TeeVee work, but it surely doesn't allow for actorly annotation like she does here.

Greenaway, of course, is one of them and the most obstreperous of the bunch. I like that he has real problems with making illustrated books and does something substantial out of that.His fundamental notions of the world are built on overlapping conceptual frameworks, ordered frameworks. In this, he follows the Joycean tradition of \"Finnegans Wake,\" which layered all sorts of frameworks from Kabbalistic, Vican, mythological, even geographic sources. It was all merged according to a dream logic  since we had no other template in that day  and used every lexical and literary device he could muster.Where Joyce had to make do with dream-layering, our Peter gets to use already familiar web- referenced multimedia overlays. He surely knows how to use the software to extend the art of editing into new dimensions. Wow, just on that score.And where Joyce used obtuse frameworks with the intent of his book being a life's reading, Greenaway uses obvious overlapping frameworks: numbers, his own life and the mythology from his prior films. Some categories, like the periodic table. Oddly, he hasn't been as thorough in this film as he has in some others: Vermeer's theories of light, animals, sexual stereotypes, the written word, various frameworks of introspection and reflection. Different slices on gender.Anyway, the point is that where Joyce was esoteric, Greenaway strives to be obvious, though manylayered, even juvenile, in his frameworks. He wants these to be so simple and grand that he can stretch them to many web sites, films, CDs, games, and (I presume) books and installations. Someone can casually enter a part of the larger work and intuit the order of the thing.Each fan of Greenaway will have to make her own decisions on what she likes in terms of the different balances he has struck. As for me, I want a tighter integration of framework and image than he has here. This is why I value his \"book\" films the highest.What does this add to what we have? Sadly, not much, except an attempt to integrate himself and some of the political sweeps of the ordinary world, which he tags to nuclear control. I've often thought that the artists themselves are dumber than the art they produce and the greater distance we have from their personalities, the better.If you have talked to Greenaway, you'll see this in a flash. He has some good headlines, having to do with the bankruptcy of narrative in film.

The outer story is a combat between Moriarty and a *retired* Holmes that ends with a chase up a medieval tower with what might have been exciting camera-work in its day.

Set philosophically in a similarly ordered mind-space, tended by two (co-equal) minds. Set dramatically in a narrative world formed by three cooperative directors (the original dramatist, the screen adapter, the filmer). Of these three, two of the affairs are false, and one is tentative. So we have the contemporary play audience flashed; we have the cinematic relationship similarly stuttered; we have the players playing actors playing roles (and one of these playing three roles to mirror the dramatist, adapter and filmer).`Love's Labor's Lost/Twelfth Night' meets `Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meets `Draughtsman's Contract.'I love the idea, and appreciate the energy of the players and the apt set: that carried me over the flaws. But these flaws are significant: the excessive self-reference kills the rhythm of internal humor, the acting about acting seems downright silly in the many places where the enveloping direction was weak. The self-conscious editing was overly explicit, and could have easily been done precisely the same with bleeds instead of cuts with greater effect and no jarring.In the case of Peploe, the intelligence outstrips the skill -- in the case of the players, it is the other way around. I think a better strategy would be to try different philosophies of acting rather all from the same tradition as we have here. A more fluid camera could have helped as well.

The first of these layers come with the ideograms: you 'tell a story' using abstract pictures that reference other stories. Masters can then add several more levels in the way you draw the characters. The result is a barrage of meanings woven by emotions. Though the concepts unroll in a linear fashion, they do so with a symphony of simultaneous and referenced 'stories,' most of them working invisibly. Space, and the things unspoken are as significant as the ink you see.Most of these poet-philosophers would reference (even devise) basic laws of life. What we know as Taoism is more a result of calligraphy as the other way. No man could be a whole man without his writing. We would be without something like this in the West until Shakespeare devised a different way of sneaking up on this, the ideograms being 'acted out' (literally as characters) with the 'laws of life' drawn from the Kabbalah of Bruno and Harriot. While China has an incredible legacy of calligraphic twists and turns, with great sweeps of changes and literally millions of masters, we have the more visceral cinema. To plum this notion of simultaneous layers from the flow of the world, we have the different curiosities of Greenaway, Ruiz, Medem, Lynch, Kelly, Quay... And Malick.I'm especially attuned to his adventures. I took classes under him when he was a philosophy professor at MIT, and he was struggling, really struggling with the inadequate 'logic of layers' available to reason about this sort of thing. (During that time, I was working to understand the geometric cosmology of the Tree of Life and incidentally how it embossed on the Jamestown story. I do not suppose a direct connection.)Now we have this marvelous poem. I see the entertainment critics are puzzled. Story-listeners wonder where the story went. Public observers cuckkle over what went wrong while forcing themselves to celebrate it because it is obviously precious. I suppose that 1300 years from now, this will be studied for the ways it interlocks the layers of experience, passion and expression, each layer with its own kinematics that touch at odd points. My grandchildrens' grandchildrens' grandchildren will remark in wonder on how much can be communicated by what is omitted. And though the technology will have changed, this will be seen to be as basic to the human expression as ink applied with a brush from the hair of your infant.You will likely know the Kabbalistic controversy, presented here as 'nature' and 'grace,' but of course that is a perspective from grace. Usually it is described as grace and knowledge-by-effort (aka 'magic') with different paths up a geometric diagram representing a tree. (Insert here the argument between Paul and George.) I wouldn't parse too much of this film using the tree of life tradition: the point is it is superlogical, but you sure can see what he is working from.One of Malick's layers is the abstract but ordered ethereal dynamics of the universe, which he conflates with the gauzy unknowns of precreation.Another is the creation of life and its dynamics; birth, sight, discovery, dominance.Yet another is the artist's personal history as a child in Waco. He presents this quite literally; though the urge of the viewer is to attach narrative to what is shown, privileging this layer over the others. Malick slips off this layer via hidden doorways, but it has resonance for me because I grew up in that era, mostly in the Jim Crow south and did many of the things shown. It was shocking how many.And another is Sean Penn recalling, creating, weaving it all together so that each layer is the origin of the others. (Our redheaded, angelic mother becomes a spiritual presence in all the layers. The most impressive is her barely recognizable figure as an aurora borealis.) Only Penn among living actors is experienced enough with narrative folds to pull off this calligraphy. (The other actor with similar vision, Heath Ledger, was to have played the opposing soul.)A key 'tree' image is that of the redheaded mother levitated in front of (in traditional terms: 'on') the tree.

By selecting this film, I wanted to find something special. So it is with regret that I post a negative comment amidst a field of glowing praise. I can only think that the difference is that tastes have changed -- more, the bar has been raised. And that's sufficiently interesting to report. Why doesn't this movie work for me, and probably would have 35 years ago? (In fact, I think it did!)What we have here is good acting by Howard and Gold Hat, a book as source with an adventurous theme for the time, and clear but not artistic cinematography. By today's standards, the sets are cheesy, Bogart's acting isn't real, and the story is scattered.About Bogart's acting. This was right before Brando (and many since) changed our expectations of the art forever. I never lost the awareness that the lines were written (they were just too clean) and that Bogart was acting. His affect was never real. Imagine Harvey Keitel, or even Tony Hopkins in the role, and you'll see what I mean. We've evolved a completely different standard of acting. We seek more immediacy to the emotional bone, more intimacy with the soul. For that matter, look at the `modern' acting of John Huston in `Chinatown,' to see how thoroughly even he changed his ideas about acting.About the story, can you imagine a scriptwriter today spending so much energy on events which neither advance the story nor increase definition of the characters? The real story setup is the `prisoner's dilemma' where what's best for an individual in a group trumps the best interests of the group (and hence all its members). Fairness fights paranoia. The lengthy prologue of being cheated could have -- with work -- supported this setup. But it doesn't! So many things could have been mutually supporting (like the letter to the wife, the rescue from the mine that wasn't really a rescue). But the standard of the era didn't require this. So the story appears scattered, unconnected to a contemporary audience.I believe that the film continues to be ranked high based on rememberance that it DID work when new, that it WAS important in its time, and that we wish to honor a past that has passed.

His great plays are about ideas, with characters as vectors to prod and activate them. This play is merely about characters, which makes it attractive to actors. That's certainly why Welles selected it.Welles is the Sinatra of dramatic reading, with phrasing mastered in his radio days. All else is acceptable (at least to my tastes) so far as the play goes.Now the shell, and here is what makes this film one of the most important. When Welles moved into film, he did so as an architect. He understood that great film constructs a space that includes the audience. So he worked with the most direct tools, buildings themselves. These sets are remarkable. I cannot imagine how he found them, how he could have seen the possibilities.Selection aside, how he uses the spaces! View this film at least once in silence.

They are too internal for realistic film, designed for direct bonding between a performer in the physical presence of his/her audience. Welles triumphed with his Othello using the trick of deep architecture, unique to my knowledge. But we still have no masterpiece film Macbeth. This is the best we have. Polanski understands the devil, specifically the celtic devil which is what this is about (written for the superstitious Scots thug James). He was masterful in other devilish stories (`Rosemary,' `Repulsion,' `Ninth Gate'), and there placed himself within the mind of the character rather than the audience (an Eastern European conceit).It doesn't work here, I think because there is a visual presence and a quite different one created by the imagination of words, and he couldn't marry the two. None of his other films have particularly worked with language well, even Tess.What we do have are some rather masterful sets (worthy of Zeffirelli), and an interesting vision of the witches.

It involves a couple and adventure; only late in the game can we put some shape on what we suspect, that someone is not who they say. It is an actor's format, indeed requires actors that we are thoroughly familiar with. This allows us to always be aware that we are watching a pretense: one soul pretending to be another.The game is in following how many layers down the pretense goes. Recently, we saw an attempt in \"Duplicity,\" which failed. It used actors who were not capable of the form, who cannot do the sort of acting where you carry your celebrity persona, the pretended identity and the \"real\" identity in every scene and in parallel. In this case, we have the actors we need.The story itself is simple. If you have no spoiler information going in, there is a pleasant surprise. All else is formula and Venice. It is that actors that make this work.Depp has always been capable of this, all the way back before he had celebrity to help. Angelina has been a pleasant surprise. Her public persona is a carefully managed role, and she seems to be capable of anything thrown at her. Here, she adds value by inserting a fourth persona (after Angelina, the lover and the agent). What she does is play Audrey Hepburn playing the lover, wide-eyed with an inner skepticism. Watch how she carries herself. Her center of gravity and the presentation of self is all in the neck, a carriage unique to this film.

But when it comes to storytelling, it has to stay fresh to retain its power. How to make a fresh love story. How?This film is built simply: build a story on the fantasy on the meme, anchor it with a few key images and surround it with some structural explanation.If you have not seen this, the spine of the thing is that a six year old girl encounters her future husband. She fantasizes about him all her life, meets him in a library (this was originally a book) where she teaches him the fantasy. They marry happily, until he dies but the love endures thereafter, powered by the story in the fantasy.The girl is presented with powers: a beautiful redhead in a sunny clean meadow having a picnic by herself — apparently for her stuffed animals, but there seems to be openness in opportunity and hopefulness of purpose. A nude man appears, and they make a pact to meet thereafter, but the timing will be unpredictable. The sun in the red hair is a cinematic staple.We later see the drawings and diary of this fantasy sustained. Notably, Rachael McAdams is photographed \"realistically,\" as is the daughter of the union who ends our story by visiting the same field in picnic. The key image we leave with is the adult running across this field, alerted by the girl that the man has appeared for a moment. These field-images are what makes the movie. It worked for me.

The movie elaborates beyond the book, as each stop along the river of time touches war, clearly stupid war, before we encounter the effects of the great war. It is simply social commentary. There is no science in the description of the machine. There is a sort of science of evolution in the outcome we see in the future.But at the time, Darwin's theories were based on fittedness and constant improvement. This was later proved wrong, but Welles could not know. So the \"evolution\" that provides the basis of the future is bogus science.Its simple social commentary taken to an abstract locale. Unfortunately, the book in its time was reported to have bite; the class system  especially in the cities  surely was as layered as this.

I liked \"Mystery Men,\" better than any Marvel-derived movie except \"Hulk\" and perhaps \"Daredevil.\"The Marvel formula was to introduce some humanity and coincident human drama around which to wrap their action panels. That placed the tone at a certain place on the comics spectrum. The tone was far less important than the placement on that spectrum.To find the same place on the movie spectrum you have to move to the absurdly human, so far to the left that only comedy  a certain fateful dark comedy  can contain it. \"Mystery Men\" made that adjustment and worked. It was funny, sure. But it was true as well, and may have been the peculiarly powerful Garafalo's best role.This is an entirely different beast altogether. It starts life as a goofy comic and is carried over as a very, very short sitcom. It doesn't try for humanity, it tries to fit the mold of sitcom characters. If you think sitcoms are life, you might believe The humor of \"Mystery Men,\" is somehow similar to this.Quite apart from that, I'm interested in how the engineers of these are attuned to political narrative. The US president, whoever he is, always attempts to define the national tone in cinematic narrative. The current occupant has been particularly effective in this regard. Essentially billions of dollars go into reinforcing this \"story,\" so it is no surprise that lots of little guys assemble in its wake to try to be pulled along.The main thread of the Republican narrative is \"stupid is endearing if the heart is in the right place.\" Purity of heart always trumps intelligence, a remarkably effective strategy to blunt any reasoned argument.So we have movies like \"Red, White and Blond,\" which not only followed the narrative but placed it in a specifically political setting.

In the thirties, spiritualism was still vital. Ghosts would speak. There were a number of attempts to relate the ghost we become when we watch action from a distance, to some sort of on screen ghost-mediator representative.Here we have a Jane Marple type, played by a famous theatrical actress. She is a medium, brought in to solve a murder by going into a trance. The actual mystery is not well woven here, but that is beside the point. The way it is reported is what is interesting. She has a contact on the other side called \"little eyes.\" (I'm not making this up.) In the middle of a séance, Little Eyes is about to reveal the name of the murderer when the querent is killed (stabbed) and the session ends. It was dark; everyone was holding hands; the room was locked; a thorough search found no knife; the medium had been tied to a chair.An inspector is called, and he enters into a standard inspector/Miss Marple mode, where she solves the mystery by once again doing a séance, this time with the corpse in a chair.

MIT had the decade before gone through a soul-searching re-evaluation of the type of scientist it was producing, and concluded that they could do much better in working toward well-rounded citizens. So by the end of the 60's they had collected - for a few years only - perhaps the strongest collection of newly emergent thinkers in the humanities. And it was quite a rich stew of ideas for a young person, the most exciting place in the world for the humanities for perhaps five years.Malick came in with this pack, concerned with newly emerging ideas about meaning and language. The philosophy establishment was forming a new split (US and Continentals) largely characterized by how to reinvent Wittgenstein's insights but with a more friendly rationale. Chomsky was shaking one world, formal abstraction for computers another. Exciting --- moreso than today. But Malick was not a verbal communicator, nor a logician, nor an academic (all sides of the same thing). So he dove into practical visual semiotics.He is not a brilliant man, merely a journalist. But he does seem to be particularly honest and understands some damned good, solid, human ideas compared to other filmmakers. One can really see this early MIT exposure in 'Red Line.'We can thankfully forget plot -- there is not meant to be any story. In fact, the war is only used here as a canvas of motion, abstractions of 'regular' life, colliding and sometimes adhering to souls, sometimes destroying them. The device is to build the film around the sounds: narrative voiceovers (current and remembered), natural sounds, haunting music. The images are attached to the sounds, which are derived from abstractions. This is exactly the reverse of Spielberg, which is why there cannot be any comparison to 'Private Ryan,' or any other film that is 'about' something. It is why Malick can never 'explain' his films.The execution is hypnotic. I wonder what the six-hour version is like. The editing (and particularly of the sound) is unusual, so transports us beyond the strangeness of tropics, war, history. That editing is much like Van Morrison's music: it establishes the rhythm only as a reference to dance around, peeking in and out. The relationship of the rhythm within the shots to the rhythm of the shots is very bluesy.Having no story opens new possibilities and creates unfamiliar problems. An opportunity is that the film can have many centers: the meditator in the midst of the attack on the camp; the squabble of the villagers; the transport of the ship; the need to look at our own dogtags. The challenge is how to end. When you stick to a formula like Spielberg, you just turn the crank and the climax lifts and comes down, and the story finishes. No story, no formula, so Malick brackets with the transport to and from the island, by the aging of the southern rookie, and by the exit from and re-entry to a world of unfamiliar characters. That they are played by familiar actors (Travolta, Clooney) oddly emphasizes the point.It must have been educational to work on this film, which is why every intelligent actor (or an actor with an intelligent agent) wanted to participate: one can see direct influence in Penn's 'The Pledge' and Cusack's 'High Fidelity,' both highly abstract.Penn knew exactly what he was doing here. He moves in the action, as an actor must. But he places his character offscreen in the abstract voiceovers. That's the 'real' Welsh, and the film's image only an abstraction. He truly understands presenting many dimensions simultaneously. Harrelson doesn't, but that's the point with Keck.

So why is this such a failure?Because both the writer and the director were without a focus, and probably without the talent to pull off realizing that focus.

I really liked this, and incidentally both `Blair Witch' projects. They incorporated neat ideas about film (regardless of whether they were consciously intended) which worked.In this case the idea is straight out of Godard. The most effective films are those in which live is `real,' where the dramatic shaping and emphases are non-existent. Or if they exist, they are discovered within life.Horror films are very much dramatized. Every element of the logic that drives the story, every event, everything we see is done so that the camera can know what is happening. These people don't exist in a 360degree universe, only in a 15 degree one so that we can see them. There isn't spontaneous, overlapping conversation, but carefully parceled, clear dialog so that we can understand. Your typical horror film spins a logic that taps our inner superstitions; then it displays the fantastic results of that superstitious fear for us to experience. The art in the ordinary tingler is in stretching out and clarifying the horror. We must _see_ it, every detail, or imagine it via standard dramatic devices as it happens off stage.So what I liked about this is that the events did not bend to the camera. The first death was a bonk on the head, and 2 seconds later, we're on to the next event. No voyeurism because as if by bad luck the camera wasn't in a good spot to gouge into the details. It just happened. (We don't even see what happened to the girl on the hook. Imagine that occurring in your typical Jason epic.)And so do all the others, until that scene with the old man and the hammer that falls out of his hand.

He requires some time in the wilderness.In the early 30's there were some precode films that copied already established genres but with toddlers playing the roles. I commented on two: \"War Babies\" and \"Runt Pages.\" Recently, I saw \"Baby Geniuses,\" which borrowed heavily in spirit — but without the sex jokes.This is also modeled in a way on those, but is schizophrenic.It was the same year that \"Wizard of Oz,\" used little people in a serious way to introduce the distorted magic of Oz. (This was before we could rely on Dr Suess.) Nearly all of these actors were in that scene, with its grueling shoot. The actual story is played almost perfectly straight. A standard script is used: cowboy romance, \"Romeo and Juliette\" family feud and romance, cattle rustling, corrupt sheriff, barroom moll... the whole works. These actors and the director take the movie seriously.On the other hand, a different director managed the musical numbers. There are a half dozen, and the novelty of little people is played to the hilt, using some actual children I think where cuteness is required. The shift in stance is radical. You can see that distributor realized that they had a problem, so here is what they did:At the beginning, an announcer comes on \"stage\" to announce that we would see a \"novelty picture\" with \"midgets.\" A one of a kind, first ever, he effuses. But he is interrupted by the actor playing the hero, who assures him that the movie is not a novelty but a real film. Then he and the film's villain engage in a bit of scripted verbal slapping that someone thought was a successful synthesis of worlds.Here's what interests me: mainstream movies have only a few seconds to work with the viewer to establish where what the world is they are entering and where they stand in it. It is critical to the success of a film that this is right. It is why genres are so strong film; there is no relief from the moving forward of the narrative. Big films today can do that by showing a synopsis of the whole movie in the long trailers we have.

Sometimes that mind is broken or limited in ways that has the serendipitous effect of creating work that the public embraces.Vincent Van Gogh is one of my icons for this phenomenon, a deeply disturbed man with vast limitations on his vision but one major crack (and a few minor ones)into a whole new world. It doesn't matter whether the artist understands this, though Vincent did and wrote eloquently on it. Either way, when the public embraces such stuff, the world changes. It shifts center to the new way and sometimes seals off the areas the artist never saw. So sometimes, effective art damages us.Cameron is a force in film, possibly as damaging in his way as Speilberg, but with far fewer and less varied films. What he sees and can display must be attractive to judge from the receipts. What he cannot see is less obvious. Here is his first real film, his `Rocky.'In my comment on `Aliens,' I noted the radically differing styles of Cameron and the man who invented the sexual, scifi horror genre. Cameron starts with the stunts, adds humor and then finds places for the actors and situations. Most work the other way around. Scott starts with a general vision first; for him, stunts are merely punctuation of the visual space. But Cameron starts with a mechanical skeleton, not at all unlike that shown here.And then his strategy is to be relentless in eliminating the human elements of the film: those elements like character development, richness of situation, emotional space. He crushes them just like Arnie's cybergoon, because they simply mess up the cleanliness of his movie. Such `soft' stuff is for wimps. Any sort of irony or annotation is for eggheads and who needs em.In the roughly 20 years since this was made, the film world has changed radically with much energy attracted to the Cameron model. The machines in Hollywood are winning. Four years later, `Die Hard' introduced a simple sort of self-effacing irony into the model and until now that is the only human remnant remaining. It is hidden, and the hardcore action guys often poke fun at it (see `XXX' vs `Men in Black 2'). And more, now life further imitates art with Arnie planning run for political office!The point is, folks that watching film can be great fun even if the films themselves are poor.

And that registration falls into one of two camps, each of which defined their own type of American novel.One camp was invented by Melville. His notion of the world was rooted in the Bible-as- allegory. He set out to create literature - a uniquely American literature - that had broad, complex sweeps of allegory. It was only incidentally about people and always steeped in some great machine that represented the world. In `Moby-Dick' that world was the world of whaling and whalers.The tapestry may be complex, but the allegory is clear and distinct. The author takes this allegory very seriously and expects the reader to as well.The other great stream of America storytelling is from Mark Twain. He tells two stories: the story itself and a story about the story. There are always two narrative levels. This is also uniquely American, especially the nature of humor in the metanarrative. It is immediately based on Austen though the particular notion has roots in Cervantes and Shakespeare. This `twoness' is why Twain chose his name. Twain's aura was of the same colors that would revolutionize the world of introspection with Freud and Darwin.Why do I mention this? Because nearly all worthwhile films these days are in the `Twain` tradition of storytelling and has been since the `new wave' of the sixties. This `American' notion has spun all sorts of cool varieties, which I am surveying in a book under the rubric of `folding.'Its just the way it is: to be considered a serious filmmaker, you have to innovate, to invent or twist some way of folding or introspection or reflection. Spielberg is a simple man who makes simple films, films that are to rest of the film world as product wrappers are to art.Having made enough money, he's been trying to make `important' films so that some day he just might be remembered as someone not unintelligent and unaware of film ideas. He's tried on a few suits, from Kubrick's folding to historical reflections. In each case they seem merely copied and he knows it.Some years back he tried a real new wave film: `Close Encounters' and even featured Truffaut as the one who `spoke the language.' A couple years ago with Hanks he tried the old folding game of a story about a guy who fabricates stories. Flat. Old shoes.Here he tries a Melville, a serious, straight ahead allegory. Presumably he thought his audience would be ready for a complex tone poem about what it might mean to be on the threshold of America. The model of the world in this case is the terminal. All sorts of little symbolic episodes are woven in, and one big one: the importance of getting a `real' image, a signature, to go with a false image (a photograph). This is mirrored by his having to get a stamp himself. The very contrast that this blunt agenda of collecting autographs has with the ad hoc nature of the Jazz involved is stark allegory - as stark as the stasis of waiting in a place that everyone else passes through.Well, as allegory for the masses, it works I suppose.

Along the way, Shakespeare both comments on and exploits the technology of the day which he employed for his many effects.Stow has selected to unfold the story, to present happenings as they chronologically happened rather than as they are remembered. This is a big mistake I think. He does exploit the technology of illusion that film allows, but he does so without selfawareness which is the whole point of the play.But you know, watching this isn't a complete waste of time, because you really need to know the play to make any sense of it.

Probably, this is no worse than thousands of slapdash dramas. What makes this interesting, almost hypnotizing, is how it rests on the rough skeleton of Shakespeare's play.

One interesting thing: The Tempest was the first great work of literature about the American experience. Almost 400 years later, it still has some of the most profound and complex visions of dealing with non-Europeans, slaves and the forces of nature in the New World.

Some films are designed to trigger this, but once in a while some rather simple film unintentionally leads me into uncharted territory. This IS a simple, unassuming film, but it prompted more rumination than say Branagh's `The Tempest' cleverly masquerading as `Dracula.'I have had only one experience with Jarman, with his `Wittgenstein,' which actually offended me with its lack of nuance. Jarman is that kind of artist who has a single impulse, one thing to say and adapts any material to support it. Like others of this type - Stone, Spike, Campion - that impulse is richer than a mere political view and their expressive talent is similarly rich. But no matter how technically sweet their expression, the fact remains that it is applied to a view of the world that bleaches rather than distills, simplifies rather than clarifies and dulls into stereotype instead of sharpening into archetype.Shakespeare works with ideas; those ideas have agency, engage in being themselves and weave their own tapestry in a spirit-like world, somewhat independent of human action. He expresses that tapestry in words where the manifold ambiguities and multiple threads reinforce each other, idea and meaning. Those words necessitate characters and situations and such, but characters are mere parts in a celestial machine. `The Tempest' is, to my mind, the most perfect and self-referential of his constructions: the one most concerned with its own nature, creation and structure. It is bottomless, worthy of exploration for years.Now, along comes a stage tradition that believes the entire world of drama revolves around characters, the way they are written and played. Unfortunately, when actors hijack Shakespeare, they turn the equation on its head. Suddenly the tapestry of finely spun ideas has to be reduced to a few strong, obvious threads in order to `explain' and support the plot. So `Romeo' becomes a love story, `Hamlet' about indecision, and `Tempest' about revenge. It is a travesty as blunt as TeeVee wrestling. So-called schools conspire with the selfishness of the theater market to perpetuate this.Now here's my dilemma. I liked this production; I really did. Miranda is supposed to be 14, sexually pure, and the `white space' on the conceptual palette. Greenaway's `Prospero's Books' - the best film Tempest by far - understood this. Around this center of discovery, which includes us the audience, swirls all sorts of confabulated issues, cosmic and trivial. At least in the play.Jarman gives us a different type of center: a buxom, sexy punk rocker who has the best understanding in the cast of vocal sculpting and presence. And at the same time, Jarman so simplifies the play and characters (by omission, by making things `clear,' by using unsophisticated language, by giving each character a `role') that he turns the whole construction on is head. Everything else is white space EXCEPT her. She is the magician. This is truly an unsettling notion. All the swishy dancing at the end is mere background noise to this dangerous notion.The photography and staging is a treat unto itself. Of all his plays, this one is the most difficult to stage because Shakespeare himself was struggling with the new technologies of the art. He created all sorts of hooks for effects, and much of the action depends on those effects. Jarman's notion is inspired, using the abbey as he does. It is perfect in its own way. Miranda's costume - the only one that matters - together with Ferdinand's nudity is pretty effective.So where I was expecting Shakespeare's engrossing insights on the superficialities of the world, I instead find myself captivated by that very world. It may take some time to recover.See this and imagine the perfect film Tempest. At the moment, I would include this dual, dangerous notion of passive/aggressive, sexuality in the girl as part of the ambiguity, something Shakespeare couldn't do (but would if he were here today). It would be between Jarman's lines and those of Larry Clark. It would be animated in the manner of `Sprited Away' (itself a version of the Tempest) but all players would be nude. It would have grand political clockworks like `Ran` and simple, imaginative love like Holly Golighty's. It would have the literary layering and emphasis on image-then-language of Greenaway. It would have all the special effects machinery of the most popular current version of `The Tempest,' `The Matrix' (without the guns and glasses), and by this I mean not the effects of the movie but of the world within.

My own theory is the influence of the Santa Fe Institute which deals with superficial effects at the threshold of (the religion of) math, but which has produced disappointing theory because their fundamental abstractions are so, well thin.So here we have an actor in a fat suit, making a film about a guy whose hefty insights into human nature turn out to be so much thin tripe. Problem is that the film itself pretends to have hefty insights into human nature (by observing and goofing on him) -- and guess what, they turn out be thin as well.We have had two stellar first films this year from writer/directors in `Panic,' and `Things you can tell by just...' The writing there was intelligent and actually insightful. Not so here. Your first clue should be that the `Steve' of the title is McQueen, a fellow famously neurotic about his macho-ness and clearly not the self-aware personality sculptor referenced here. I suppose that the writers originally had a more metaphoric, talky approach in mind, perhaps as intelligently conceived as meals with Andre and Vanya. But as the discussion on the DVD so frankly shows, they continually watered it down with community theater values. They should have gone for the gold.If you like the thin sentimentality and vapid emotionalism that characterizes this film, go see `You can count on me' instead. It at least has better acting, a kid and everyone's teeth are clean.","id":"rw0706083"},{"movie":"ShakespeaRe-Told:The Taming of the Shrew","heading":"Let Me Kiss You Kate","date":"9 May 2010","content":"This is not a very good Shakespeare in my estimation, though everyone looks for different things, probably valuing others. There is no grand struggle here for control over the universe, and of course none of what happens — struggle or no — happens in the language.But it is a crackling good movie. It has Shirley Henderson in the main role. I've long admired how she grabs the frame. Instead of her being defeated by a barrage of words, completely submerged as the real Kate is, she wins. She wins because everything around her is controlled by her. When the couple is happy, it is because both her character allows his quirks and also because she lets him into the film she commands as an actress. In time, she may become as tiresome as Judi Dench, but for now she is welcome.This has a terrific score.

Its because the material is so deep and dangerous, that it can cut and ruin lives of innocents just as it can build and weave. Part of the danger comes from not being aware of the edges, of thinking that what you see is a comedy as toothless as something from TeeVee. But part is also a matter of decisions the director makes.There are a few major traditions the director can follow. A focus on the sweep of cosmology, on the (usual) intricacies of plot. On the fabulous language, its structure and ever-more layered metaphors. Its emotional shivers, yes even the comedies. Sometimes the way chosen is to map it to some other era and its trappings to increase \"relevance,\" as if \"West Side Story\" had the stuff from which one builds imagination.But the most dangerous choice of all, I believe, is when the director chooses to make the play about humans, to make it emotionally real. I mean \"emotionally\" here in the modern theatrical sense where screams and actorly attunement really can connect. Its probably a bad choice because when you try to make these characters modern, natural, as if you could encounter them in life, you fool yourself into thinking you understand the thing. You see familiar people, reacting in familiar ways, lifelike. But that's not how these plays are put together. There's always the majority of it just out of reach. There's always more, even if you read it slowly. That's what makes this magical. It isn't Ibsen. When the director takes those heavens away, the knife becomes dull and there is no instrument on earth as dangerous as a dull knife.Just look at the comments here on IMDb, celebrating the accessibility of this production. Yes, it is probably more comprehendible than Zeferelli's zany snappings. But that had the language, and it preserved the cadence as poetry, and thus indicated how layered were the metaphors, how nested were the rhythms, how integrated the language was with human intercourse, how dissymmetry is behind the tension the keeps love afloat.Nothing of that is here.

Burton was of that English stock of actors who first would engineer the words in designing the character. Then he would figure out the bodily and facial motions. The reading was the core. That belief comes in part from the minute variations in speech that discriminate class in Britain.Burton was fresh from his/her success in \"Woolf,\" a project that was engineered differently, one in which the words don't matter as much as how they support the weaving of the characters. Mike Nichols stuff.Zeffirelli has a different motive altogether. His notion is to take something inherently rich -- which is how he sees Shakespeare's plays -- and increase that enrichment with the addition of cinematic luxury.Add to this mix old Will himself. He's all about situation, at least in the comedies of this period. Disguises, and hidden stratagems that misdirect. Everything is annotation to that, starting with the poetry, then the language, then -- and only then -- the characters and finally and only nominally the set.Four different theatrical notions. Here they are squeezed together without merging: Burton working his vocal shapes to death in the context of a Nichols-like \"combat\" between the then two most famous actors alive. Both him and Zeffirelli picking and choosing which phrases to selectively use to support their conflicting goals. And around those phrases Zeffirelli swirls with exiting visuals and music.What a hash. You should know that Shakespeare wrote comedies set in Italy because Italians were seen as comical. The way they elaborated language apart from meaning. The way they dressed where the decor had nothing to do with the purpose, so far outstripping it that by Elizabethan conventions just seeing an Italian in dress would elicit guffaws. Shakespeare's plays were essentially without sets, so some of the language would be designed to have the audience imagine a humorous excess of surrounding.Now along comes an Italian to reshape the plays. And he brings the very excess that is the whole tenor of the joke. And along comes an actor that -- quite independent of that -- wants to turn what is a tussle of words into a tussle of emotions. This is also an Italian flaw that Elizabethans would have laughed at.So instead of mining the inherent richness of the play, we mine the inherent ridiculousness around which the play builds its riches. That ridiculousness is enriched in appropriately ridiculous ways: campy theatrical rage; astoundingly colorful clothes (influencing and influenced by The Beatles and later to form the basis of their clothing store run by the aptly named \"Fool\"), and swirling motion of the crowds.Everybody loses.

It matters, so prepare your day accordingly.Its not as miraculous as \"Red Shoes.\" But it is bigger. It is folded like Shoes, but less delicately. In the case of the previous project, the story was about a performer, who glided in and out of the movie and the movie within, the two overlapping magically.Here we have the same dancer, the marvelous, redheaded Moira Shearer. And her dance merges with the movie, but the movie is a heavier construction:It is a movie of an opera of a ballet performance wherein we embed three stories. The stories themselves fold into each other, each a story of Hoffman in love with a woman manipulated by an evil man-spirit. He's the same man in each case, of course. In each of the four cases (the three stories and the outside of the ballet), he prevents the lovers from uniting.These guys Powell and Pressburger, don't know much about the immediacy of storytelling. They don't know long form pacing. They don't know deep emotional engagement. But they sure know how to stage some of the most marvelous effects and build to them. They know something about photographing dance and what balance means to a camera. And they are perhaps the masters at cinematic folding: the ways of visually ambiguating the play and the audience.I may put this on my list of films you must see before you die. We'll see how I feel about it in a month, if I still am affected in my dreams.One thing that enhances this: Hoffmann is in love with Moira's Ballet character, someone he says embodies all three of his previous, lost loves, the first of which is also Moira. She's redhead. The director's love is also a redhead, one Pamela Brown who plays Hoffmann's (male) attendant. He remained devoted to her for the 25 years until her death. His attentiveness to her, hers to Hoffmann, and Hoffmann's to Moira's character is a sort of circle. Its ironic then that Moira's participation in Powell's two ballet movies ruined her career.I saw this together with \"Nightdreams,\" a porn film from the early eighties. It was episodic like this, worked with women stereotypes like this in a context of extreme fantasy and demons, and helplessness. Same sort of notion: story, tension, attraction, obsession.

Well, this doesn't work for me. Am I the only one who thinks that Matt Damon has a hard time? Oh he tries hard enough, but he wants us to know it. There are lots of acting styles out there. But this `watch me work' style is distracting.This director and I do not connect. He's fundamentally a storyteller via narratives from novels. This is pretty risky business, partially because of the fundamental differences in narrative requirements --  between seeing in your mind and on screen. Also, he picks books with some adventure in narrative structure. His approach is to distract by focusing on intense acting to fill multidimensional characters. A second tactic is to distract with some lush texture or another.The first trick fails because he has thin actors this time around, as opposed to the strong ones in `English Patient.' Jude Law has some potential it seems, but the others aren't very intelligent. Don't they know not to put actor interviews on DVDs if all they can say is vapid?The second trick fails because the director just doesn't have the skills to sustain a strong, unfamiliar thematic vision outside of the desert.

Both Japanese and the west look on that collection of cultural relics, sometimes to mine for expressive power.(Arabia and Persia have a similar dynamic which differs in being based on knowledge rather than refinements in society. It also differs in that it destroyed what they had themselves  and deliberately, so only the anger at loss remains and none of the reference to introspection.)As I watch movies and think about them, I'll see this mining dynamic at work. Kurosawa, of course, took some of the notions of watching and examining too far for most Japanese. While he was rejected in Japan, he was celebrated in the west for being truly Japanese, because he was dramatic with these cultural relics. That is to say, he handled them with distance, literally spatial distance, and so exaggerated their qualities that in the process of entering our minds, the exaggerations were normalized so they seemed real.Its why theater needs to amplify certain qualities in embodiments, so the conveyance matters.Now what happens when an artist forgets that and takes these Japanese target stories as if they were real, and mines them as if they directly mattered? What if the artist is non-Japanese and so automatically outside but has no sense of that fact? What if that artist is tuned to a subconscious guilt associated with otherness. If that otherness is the to some repellent notion of whaling, you get \"Drawing Restraint.\"If those notions are associated with immoral war, then the topic is Hiroshima, and you'll get this. But in this case, matters get thoroughly confused, because what we see is the destruction of a culture, creating images that no longer live. And yet it is conveyed through those very same images as if they do live. And yes, we have quotes  many  from Kurosawa and subsequent Kurosawa-influenced filmmakers. (In a double irony, most of these are Chinese  no, triple irony if we really are talking about war and genocide.)This is often lovely, but rarely emotionally engaging. There's that cognitive disconnect I just mentioned. But something else. Dance. The humans here are dancers. The choreography is supposed to complement the visuals, which as I said use fragments of a society and an anime form. But it faux drama. Bodies writhe in pain, are poisoned by acid, then radioactive rain. Can dance be dramatic? Can it work in the same way that acting does, to provide deep connection at this level? Or is it intrinsically placed in another deep center?I have no answer. But here it fails.

Its flaws, in my mind, all had to do with the construction of the narrative long form. I have lots of room in my imagination for experiments, adventures, challenge. But to do this, you have to master and extend the way we deal with narrative. Its a matter of hardwiring under convention. The greatest offense is when a filmmaker mistakes overloading for extension, and gives us a long form composed of genre segments. I understand why Baz did this; he was growing the annotative style he mastered in \"Moulin Rouge.\" He actually came close with the dreaming, singing thing. Even in failure, he is worth the investment.Here we have the very same failure: too much story as a substitute for good story. An overload of borrowed narrative chunks shuffled together as an excuse for narrative.

Like everyone else in the business without a unique soul, they are chasing Pixar, who pays special attention to story and framing. Framing in this context means the handling of space. Watch this feature from the perspective of perspective to see what I mean. Things are framed on the edge just as Pixar does, with angles, movements and establishing shots that are slightly  ever so slightly more radical than the usual. But look at what they get wrong. Pixar and Welles when they do this it is all about environments. The space is what matters and incidentally there are people. This takes work, especially when you are animating because it means you have to work from the outside in. Dreamworks goes the other way: they design the shots around the lead characters and then fill in the backgrounds with lesser technology. The environment is an artifact only, not intrinsic to what you see. We see objects. The animators are so aware of this that they even make a character  someone that fits the story not at all  out of disconnected objects.The key woman in this is a redhead.

Le Carre's books are well-done fabrications -- good storytelling, or at least good enough to sell books.

This I DO know, and it is mawkishly sentimental, aggressively raw, substituting voyeuristic pain for art.And from this Egoyan has carved an object so complex and nuanced, so softly woven into our minds, the effect itself shocks.The whole thing revolves around two deft tricks: one is the mystery of why the girl lies, which is not wholly because of fraternal sexual abuse, but you don't get that until the very end when what we know about Billy Ansell comes into focus. Then every element of the narrative is brought into question, as surely as \"Usual Suspects\" or \"Cabinet of Dr Caligari\" but without drawing attention to itself.The real innovation, the real mastery, is the folding of narrative: different times, different perspectives, different truths (some reporters are lying), mirrored multiple realities, conflicting tenses all brought into apparent harmony or at least stasis. In fact the mirroring and folding and shifting is profound, but it all seems so natural one doesn't notice that the underlying physics of the world has shifted.The fundamental problem filmmakers face is how to manage narrative. It is a far more difficult problem than is the case with novels. Experiments abound, usually with obvious mechanics and it is now an accepted genre to focus on those mechanics.

The closest we come to filmed paranoia these days is `Requiem for a Dream' and `Trainspotting,' both of which set a distance between us and them who are cursed.For these kinds of films to work, the film within needs to overlap with the film without, and ideally the additional layer of reality. `The French Lieutenant's Woman' is the gold standard in this respect. You also need actors who can shift realities and often play simultaneous levels.

Its absolutely perfect in how all the parts seamlessly fit together and those parts and the assembly fit with the world.Westerns aren't unique to film; long before movies, pulp stories were weaving the abstractions that movies inherited. But its a specific type of mythology that movies perfected. From the midthirties until the Leone era, these were the slate on which Americans drew their character.They're roughly in two types. One is the the narrative spun by John Ford and  for better or worse  appropriated by Republicans (as I write this). Simple men, drinkin', fightin', cussin' misogynists who \"win\" their women. These are men nestled into the land, free in spirit, loners. Quick to violence and often motivated by revenge-as-justice.The unhappy fact is that John Ford was Jerry Bruckheimer before it became uncool.There's a different western: cowboys with a higher sense of justice. Rather than being motivated by revenge, he'll drive a story often based on redemption. He's likely to sing. He always gets the girl, but somehow we feel that it is because the woman is seeking a husband rather than rough sex.Gene Autry isn't the first player I think of in this context. (His first movie, a serial actually  \"Phantom Empire\"  is on my list of \"must see.\") But this movie is so well quilted, so naturally centered in all the things that westerns can be.

This is a very disturbed world, reinterpreted through the elder Kurosawan eye of the determined elder Straight to seem more desperately rosey than it is. Consider this like the first half of \"Mulholland Drive,\" and a more intelligent film it is, because it asks you to provide the last half.The magic in the movie is not that it is saccharin, nor that it has strychnine, but that it is an homage to other filmmakers: Altman, Kurosawa, de Palma, Greenaway.

One of his examples was this fellow, Klushantsev. He was great in two dimensions. One was in the stagecraft, the visual trickery that made pretend things seem real on screen. But far deeper than that, it was his vision of the future that the effects were turned to illustrating. I don't know of any other instance where this was attempted, even unsuccessfully. His visions were so striking, so attractive that essentially every space movie builds on his notions. Though his personal history is sad  he suffered under the stupid government  the history of his work is much better. That's because he happened to fall in the moment between two massive civilizations, each yearning for space. Their yearning adopted his vision.A non-scientist, he may have been the most influential in science for decades. Why, I wonder?Was it because the effects were convincing? Were they convincing because he simply saw how the visual logic of technology worked? Can one \"see\" how things must be? Can one man pull an entire universe, trillions of dollars? Can he create an ambition so grand that two superpowers cannot touch it? I recently heard someone make a big deal out of Tesla. I credit this man with more. Tesla merely invented real things, while this man saw inventions, and left the mere inventions to others.

The world is not composed of narratives; we impose them. I tend to be more interested in the structural limits of this behavior than the case where the reporter's bias dominates. In other words, there is an unrealistic transformation that inevitably occurs when you observe the world and build a story.As it happens, this is the chief problem that the NSA has. It has a great many facts, orders of magnitude more than August 2001. But it has no way to pull meaningful stories from them, and \"stories\" where intent and projected futures are apparent are what intelligence analysts are all about. Getting stories of any kind is difficult for interesting reasons not relevant here.But when you do pull narrative out of facts, you have that distorted lensing that you have to account for. It isn't reality, but a linearized model with observational, situated inadequacies. This is something I work on professionally.So it is a strange fold of sorts to see this TeeVee movie about the NSA. It is produced, and I suppose largely written by James Bamford, who also appears as witness, investigator and narrator. Bamford has been writing about the NSA since long before it was officially acknowledged, and his writings were very much that sort of distorted lens. How do physicists talk about quarks, being denied the ability to experience them as worldly objects? The same way that Bamford indirectly observed what is surely that largest, most complex and advanced technical/mathematical enterprise ever. NSA exists now. It appears on maps, has a website and a more or less known budget. But it is still occluded from view. Most people who work there know little more than J Q public. But we have a detailed picture of what the place is and does. It all came from Bamford, all of it, until about 8 years ago. His lens, his story. Early physicists thought of atoms and its constituents as tiny planetary systems. Its absurdly wrong in nearly every way, but we still teach and use that story, well because it was first.Bamford's lens was the first with NSA. You will get a chance, if you watch this, to see him in action. He has many more facts than he did 25 years ago, and we can assume that they are correct, true in the ordinary sense. But he is using the same narrative. That is — if you are keeping track — about 9 generations in the computing theory and technology, and 3 in the key mathematical disciplines involved.The NSA is profoundly broken, because of this lensing problem. If you watch this, you can see how that very lensing problem is presented in a similarly, profoundly broken way for the same reason.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw2124501"},{"movie":"Spiderwick","heading":"Evil Steals the Book","date":"29 March 2008","content":"John Sayles has never let me down before. But he surely has this time with this wildly tepid movie. I suppose there are so many child-magic \"save the world\" movies because kids are really easy to please.

And you need to have basic narrative shape to the thing.This has none of that. Now this may just be my experience, because I made the mistake of seeing it in Imax, and when things get bigger you expect the spaces to be filled.

Most of it is far worse than I remembered. I mean both that the cinematic methods seemed more tired now that we can see how limited it is. I also mean that the thing within, the story is meaningless.

You can like the noise and thrill, or the engaging nature of the characters, or the appeal of the world and its cosmology, or many other things. I've been taught a law about this — the law of the required first. For something to bind to you in an important way, it has to be the second thing you touch. The first thing may attract you, or merely be the closest to you. A successful film (or anything that goes to compose a human) will have to have both: that first landing place that releases you and sends you in the direction and scent of the second, into which you penetrate. This is a profoundly junky film, which is to say that it is typical Bruckheimer. You will likely leave the theater a bit disgusted, especially if you saw \"Inception\" first. But there is something very appealing about this. Almost by accident, they seem to have stumbled upon an attractive cosmology, and a very well put together story structure. Everything about the telling of the story fails, but the spine of the thing is sturdy, right. Evil is an invented concept, comparatively quite modern. Even more recent is the notion that it can be vanquished or countered by human activity. We need this in our lives, and seek out anything that reinforces it. We invented a sort of counter-noir of an ordinary schmuck that gets caught in this grand battle and wins by inherent goodness (and some dedication). He gets the western equivalent of the 72 virgins. I liked this film, in spite of its crass, cheap fakery. I think that for me the initial touchpoint was the anti-noir hero bit. I'm not immune to that — I suppose few people are because the more you work to avoid being manipulated, the more of a hero you allow yourself to be. But that initial landing is inadequate, and we release ourselves from it in the first 15 minutes, enough for the first action scene to play out. The thing that sticks for me is the well-conceived notion of love as containment. Everything here is about containment. We have the Russian dolls, the so-called grimhold, in which successive layers of sorcerers are locked, surrounding the innermost evil. We have that woman contained in another's body. The two warring men spend a decade locked in a vase. The ultimate battle is to be held against the dead released from their containment. Much is made of being IN the shoes, IN the Faraday cage and IN a magical circle. This may be too subliminal for most, but for me it really colored what it means when the characters say they are in love and that love drives them. This is the second touchpoint, the place where I entered this film in spite of its ugly self. And it allowed me to appreciated the rather remarkable set that was designed as Dave's lab. They could have used the camera in a more modern, spatial way, especially during the sparkmusic. But it was rewarding enough. Someone bright gave us two action sequences in subway stations so that we would register that lab to effect.

No matter how you define a spectrum, say from teacher to codiscoverer, it cannot be a smooth line. For some hardwired reason, both we as the reader/viewer and the writer/filmmaker snap to only a small number of stations along those lines.Being a lucid viewer means, I think, in part being aware where you have snapped to an a similar set of lines and where you suppose the narrative stance to be anchored. Clever writers can play with ambiguities, but even if they are not, clever viewers can play. We can play from our end.But that means we have to explore all the stations, to reference each one by the others.

There's the original sequence of stories which exploited the simple tension of discarded talent in a city that both worships talent and discards people wholesale. These were simple structures, headlines and patronizing prose. There's the screenplay by a hack, with simple shape and essentially no movement. In other words, forget what people usually think a movie is about: the people and the story. Those parts are missing. There is no happy ending. There is no redemption.But this has three things: madness, music and the marriage of madness and music.I saw this right after \"State of Play,\" a traditional newspaper movie, with archetypal writer and editor. This is a modern version with two of our most folded actors: Downey and Keener. Their job is simple: define an edge between internal and external. The coupled acting here is not between Downey and Foxx, but between Downey and Keener playing a recently divorced couple. There's a quiet tension these two build around the absent son, whose place Foxx's character fills.Foxx makes not a character but an phenomenon, an experience, this experience of madness in music. He is helped by being placed amid folks who we are told are \"real disturbed people.\" What Wright has is a fairly vacuous notion of madness, but a sublime talent in expressing it cinematically. Some of his tricks are trivial when considered independently: a cutout of Ayers getting smaller and \"disappearing into\" the music; a cheesy light show to Beethoven; an attempt to conflate voices in the head to music in the head. This latter is very real but the expression is cheap.While they seem trite individually, none are used heavily or relied on. And the effect when combined with more masterly things produces a symphony of excess. Downey's character remarks on the sheer depth, the love the penetration in describing just this very thing we see. It works. Music, indeed all real paths through passion are madness. Every adventure into commitment is a step outside safety of self.Wright knows this. He feels it. He can show it. I can trust him with my life.

The writer here does simple, clean, dialog-laden plots for TeeVee.They decided to go for an economical story, something that we can walk into with all sorts of questions about the world and how it is changing and come out believing we understand it.The facts are intimidating. Soon, Facebook will have a billion users. It is already the most visited site in history. As an entity, it already is on par with the the top tier tech companies: Apple and Google. But far beyond that, far, far more significant is the way that the world is changing. Until now, friendship was absolutely anchored in physical proximity. All media allowed that to be extended, but only if it were well established by actually being together.Now, this notion is being replaced by an entire generation. The compact is no longer on mutual support and emotional needs, but simply being paid attention to. Life is flattened while the numbers get larger. Shared abstract thinking is reduced to whether something is \"liked\" or not. Political movements exploit this and we are getting into trouble faster than we can imagine. So we enter a theater with a film about this phenomenon with dire worries. Social networking is the successor to TeeVee as the next possible disaster in the social experiment.The filmmaker and writer decided to make a movie about this simplification of the social fabric by taking a story that is necessarily rich and human, and reduce it to a cartoon. We liked it not because the thing is well crafted, though it is. We embrace it because it explains things. In fact, it simplifies things so much that we can feel superior in knowing that we would have made a (slightly) more rich version.The story presented here is no secret: emotionally weak geek type, Jew, Harvard undergrad has trouble making friends. Each of these three stereotypes is exploited shamelessly in the service of an unambiguous narrative. This guy will do anything to make friends and elevate his social standing. But the only thing he can do is program, so he finds what he needs in a website he creates. There is a clear calculus of sacrificing real friends for virtual standing. It is not something he can do because he understands people; it is something he has to do because he doesn't.Turns out is what others need is similar so the thing takes off. Advisors, investors and lawyers surround the thing. Simple. Our hero ends up alone. The story marginalizes women as a necessity, deliberately allowing us to see them as Zuck does. More stereotypes.But what has been done here is a type of narrative fold. The subject is the flattening of the human relationship to the trivial. The movie itself is the similar flattening of the story to the trivial. It is what it shows and implicitly criticizes. We walk out \"understanding,\" in that way we do after a political rally before we actually start thinking and seeing real people.In the real world, what is interesting is not what happened with a girlfriend or some jock twins. What matters is the way that connection is changing, the way we form associations and indeed what an association means and what value it gives. This is not a fad. Facebook and Twitter may fade but something profound has started, perhaps changing the very nature of what it means to invest in societies. We likely are not yet past a tipping point in government and family units, but it is likely that we are well past the tipping point in narratives. We may never get richness back as a basic value. It will be relegated to a few who form a social network.It is also interesting that Zukerberg, Dorsey, Canter, Mullenweg and Winer truly believe that what they are about amplifies life in all its dimensions. They believe they are doing good work. If this film is anything, it is evidence that the contrary is true.And Zuck isn't cool enough to be an Emacs user any more, though he seems to have a genius in the opposite direction: finding the lowest common, scalable need.(Written from the Starbucks two blocks from the original Facebook office.)Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","id":"rw2324509"},{"movie":"The Smokers","heading":"The Little Sister","date":"26 June 2003","content":"Spoilers herein.You already know this is a disaster: an edgy film that is incompetently tepid.

No character makes decisions. No control of any kind is given to anyone. All the characters tumble towards a bleakness not of their doing.That makes for pretty weak drama, no matter how earnest the actors. That's because you lose all the drama. The story has nothing to do with what happens. The characters are mere snowflakes in a blizzard. They merely indicate rather than drive, an actor's nightmare.This is further limited here by the unrisky approach. It is as if cruel fate came in portion controlled packages. An example is the clumsy love scene, perfectly unclumsy in its staging, partly to allow engineered modesty and partly to facilitate borrowed camera angles.The actors themselves cannot risk because the filmmakers never define the area of risk.

Its an annotative hoot sometimes.The general report here is that this is a bad movie. Its bad you see, because it changes the story around from the book. Therefore it \"isn't Christie.\"Its funny. What I saw was profoundly along the lines of Christie. The things I liked and didn't were precisely the things I like and dislike about her books. I'll recommend you stay away from this, but its because the weaknesses of Christie outweigh her strengths here.Her strengths are in how she plays with the mystery formula. Things are never as they seem. Of course in mystery, that's the whole point, but the surprises are  until her  well within the delimited area of the story. What she did was push those limits away. Each time it was a different puncture in the fence, and to make it dramatic, she would conform more rigidly to other elements of the convention. Here, the murderer is more than just a surprise, its a surprise outside of the genre. She didn't always \"play fare\" according to the Sayers Rules, where the reader could have figured things out based on clues. Its against her that she would go for the thrilling surprise instead of the complex engagement, the game.The way that the adapter has handled this is exceptionally well, I think. To move from one medium to the other and preserve the original, you really must change the original. They've done that so that story does work. Except for the role that Marple plays. Her stories depend on the fact that she is obnoxious, unlikeable, but with deep intuition. She's no Poirot, who works on logic. She uses induction rather than deduction and her poking of things is required. Here she is merely a detective, remote and not poking her nose in.Another one thing about Christie that annoys me is that she feels the need to amuse but doesn't have the literary skills for it. So you'll find her setups very choppy in tone and sequencing. That also is captured here in an anachronistic editing style and score. Its directly borrowed from the first Batman movie.

Garcia does this well in his films on women, having multiple vignettes that set perimeter points. If you want a whole, multidimensional woman, you can fill in from those well chosen markers.Another device is what we have here. One girl split into four archetypes: the needy athletic striver; the suppressed honest romantic; the one haunted by family and self-image problems and the geekly, lonely one.Make no mistake, these are meant to be subconsciously perceived as one soul. They all share one pelvis, suggested here by \"magical\" pants that fit \"perfectly.\" So far, not interesting, even though one of these actresses is very pretty and another talented.Here's what clever students of scriptwriting need to pay attention to: this is a book that was written to be a movie. So you must have one of these girlparts be a writer. In this case it is the fat one, the female author's comment on herself. And another must be the filmmakerpart. Of course.And we see the film literally being constructed by our talented miss who has to tolerate the stupidities of the commercial workplace.So this is doubly folded: four perspectives into one: and another two perspectives into one  the two that have Tibby in the story and the one who is outside the story bringing it to us.This is clever construction folks. If you are offended by girlygirl cheap sentimentality and ordinary presentation, at least you will find the construction of this intriguing.

It had depth and resonance. Eight years later, some hack remade the movie in English, changing the Chinese family to a Mexican one. Using almost precisely the same script, it turned into a horrible, horrible little film. Soulless. Now turn to this. The original \"detective\" was one of the best film projects in history. I have it on my list of films every living person should see. It is the only thing I have ever seen from TeeVee that is worth watching. Its construction is ineffable and deep: three realities, each of which co- creates the others. Now shift to the mind of Mel Gibson, the fellow behind this project. He is incapable of understanding or even seeing depth, surely in projects like this. What he has done is take a story about stories and storytelling, about parallel interwoven realities, about the nature of creation, about the origin of invention in sex and pain...... and replaced it with something that looks the same and has the same events, but which has all the nuance and life bleached out of it. Now, we have a completely understandable narrative about a man who imagines and remembers things. All is clear, all is simple.This is the same man who at this same time was doing the same thing to a similarly rich and deep and inscrutable story, the one about Jesus.This is a travesty, a pure travesty. I recommend the original, but not this.Just as a side matter, the threads that tied the realities together in the original were the women. The redness of their hair mattered. A lot.

It is a standing challenge to my friends to show me something that is produced for TeeVee that does less harm than good in working with the viewer's mind.I finally have it here. Lynch's `Twin Peaks' experiment came close, but turned into a comment on the empty soul of TeeVee as the basic material was passed from one director to another, each trapped by different restrictions in the medium. Lynch finally had to `fix' it by making a wrapper film that brilliantly references those bounds.What we have here is something that spreads out and takes time to percolate. It is designed to coherently be delivered in small discrete parts. I saw it on DVD but can imagine it not being destroyed by those pesky interruptions and the delay between broadcasts.The idea is pretty complex for TeeVee: five levels of narrative, three in story, one in reference and one in a particularly strong use of song as narrative. This last is so novel and different from the conventions of artificial reality we've come to expect in musicals that it alone makes it interesting.The nominal base level is Marlow the writer in a hospital. He has a story that was written, is being written and rewritten and adapted. It is also what we see.Above these two levels is the explicit recognition that Potter, the `real' writer is Marlow, the fictional writer. This is wisely not introduced in any meaningful way until the 4th episode, including the notion that the characters at all levels are in control.Below these three levels is the story of his `murder' of his mother, his own `detection' and the ghosts of character.Permeating all is that fifth level, narrative assembled and saturated by popular song. Some characters and actors, even gestures and props (like that one shoe) appear in all five levels. Redheads are used in a particular clever way. (A project with similar tone and aspirations was \"Draughtsman's Contract\" which inspired Potter and which also features Janet Suzman.)But as time goes on, we can see that each level struggles to be the generator of the others. Particularly sweet is the notion that the singing detective can sing and think at the same time and what we see at all levels is what he thinks. Over time it becomes more viable to see the situation in any one layer as written (or imagined) in any other. Along the way he provides clear tools for doing so.The interesting thing here is that Potter uses the time of the miniseries format wisely. He introduces a new layer or idea or narrative folding in each half hour. Only so fast as we can adapt. He uses the same material over and over, but always in a new context. It is exactly anti-TeeVee in this way as TeeVee depends on a consistency of context as frame. Here, the frame shifts, and the whole point of the context is to provide levers for that shifting.That's what the detective story is all about: starting with events and locating a frame. And why it revolutionized literature. Too bad the appearance of this didn't revolutionize TeeVee.I haven't yet seen the 2003 film version, with the amazing Downey as Marlow. But it seems that this exploration in causal frames needs time to stretch, because one of Potter's tricks is to use the fact that his scope exceeds that we normally swallow in a 90 minute film experience.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw0229062"},{"movie":"The Simpsons filmen","heading":"The King's Muted Jester","date":"26 August 2007","content":"I don't do TeeVee, so my encounters with these are either through reader recommendations, the usual case, or when something has a movie theater incarnation.

Some win, some lose. Some adapt to survive.The viewing public has its needs, its stories that it wishes to have reinforced. The market pull in most cases isn't a need to be amused, rather to be reinforced. The push is the ability to sell the most, the very most tickets, so the broadest strokes only.That makes these dead armies easy to interpret.When film was new, it had many identities that it could have adopted. If you go back and look at the early projects, you'll see possibilities that continue traditions from other arts: dance, photography (itself newish), painting, literature, and surely theater  continuing the few well defined theatrical traditions.Along came D W Griffith and he swept all the possibilities to the side but one. Since then, its been a struggle for some of the more clever notions to come back. I study one collection of those \"other\" traditions.The Griffith notion was to alternate (not quite \"combine\") between stage drama which involved simple stories and grand sweeps of outside action. The stage dramas had to be simple, usually placed and shot the same way they would appear in the theater. Usually it was a love or revenge story. The outside bits were unique to cinema.This was not a good thing in my opinion, this suppression of the more powerful possibilities of film. The Griffith notion relies on the stage bits to provide a narrative and the grand sweeps to amplify elements of that narrative.C B deMille continued this notion in talkies. He's the enemy of intelligent cinema and because so many political/religious decisions are based on what's stirred up, he's responsible for huge errors in society.This may be the most interesting example of this river of influence.Its religion, politics, love and ironic folding in one package.The big sweep is that corrupt political power is bad for true goodness. Remember that this is toward the McCarthy era in US politics where evil communist dictatorships were threatening the Christian American way. (Compare this to \"Birth of a Nation.\") That allows for a cinematic sweep. Today, usually the sweep is used to \"show\" human emotions. Chinese filmmakers in particular like to show individual tensions by showing similar tensions in society, write large. This is reversed, a rather childish romance is included to annotate the grand sweep rather than the other way around.Two interesting things.The first is the very real presence that movies create in real life. Regardless of where you stand in matters of faith, its plain to anyone that the actual images and values come to us through media, and so far as religion that means film images. DeMille himself was Jew but he understood how to milk the religious imagination. Hollywood invented the robes and sandals that every Sunday School kid encounters in drawings. Hollywood invented the shape of the score many folks associate with heaven.And here, here it is. Spirtuality invented.The second interesting thing is how this folds back on itself. The whole thing exists to set up the events at the end: a show for Roman citizens in the Coleseum at the end. Its an odd ambiguity. We are told that this show is perverted and the people for whom it is created are of the devil, opposed to everything good we are shown. Yet the very reason this movie exists is so we can gawk at people being torn apart.The effects are laughable by today's standards. But in their day they were spectacularly brutal. The movie was made so we could revel in that brutality and get precisely the same reward the Roman viewers do.More, that carries over to the love story setup: we are presented with two women, the holy one and the privileged slut. All the plot points are directed toward artificial events so we can see the slut, bathing in her sexuality not on our terms, but hers. A nude bath is created only for us to gawk as Romans.There are many teen movies today that poke fun at stupid teens that have certain qualities then depend on those same qualities to get laughs (and admission dollars). But this is an extreme  or was until Mel Gibson. It defines religious image and value in a way that absolutely undermines it.

In the best, there is some tension as we know the detective is ahead of us in deducing the truth from the same information we have. If you deviate from this, there should be some value because the cost is relatively high.Now here we have one of the earliest experiments with detective talkies and they went directly to Holmes. What they did here was break the rule in an odd and experimental way. All the history that we are supposed to discover is presented before we even meet Holmes. That is, the story is presented in the historical order of events instead of the order of discovery. I cannot know the effect this had on the audience when it was new. This film is far closer to when the Holmes stories appeared than it is to me here now. But my guess is that it failed. There is another experiment, and pretty interesting. Two scenes are shot from high. One of these has an established human perspective: Holmes climbs up a ladder and when he comes down, the camera stays there looking down. Later, when the big chase/fight climax is going on, we again have the camera at this angle — a little further away.

We would never conduct an extraordinary rendition.I myself saw this and felt the same: it was just too unrealistic and seemed to unnecessarily hammer a point. Surely we all knew that what makes America special is its consistent rule of law. That was then. This is now. Now we know the president authorized torture, ignored the law.

Her figure is rather ordinary, which is to say realistic.She had a pretty face, but no more so than hundreds of others from the era. What she had instead was a sense of self that seemingly by accident was conveyed by the camera. Even today, it is remarkable, though it surely has a different effect. She seems to have been one of the smartest women to pass through Hollywood. She's famous for crediting her success merely on knowing how to dress, carry herself, and maintain an attitude.

It is a story with great exaggeration, which contains a writer who must use great exaggeration in his stories. Much of the exposition explains why, and draws the reader into the space between the cartoon that is the book and the cartoon that is the newscolumn without us noticing that we are goofing on ourselves.The template for the mechanism is the first such superreal novel: `Cannery Row.' This is copied even down to the destructive party. Except here, the humor was from a different locale, superficially a minor transposition. But there was even self-reference in that treatment of the locale: studied treatment on the immoveability of place: including deep use of local language, the business of the restrained house, and the extended metaphor of the oil tankersSo when I heard of the cast, I had great hopes. Cate and Julianne are the two living actresses capable of projecting just this kind of self-reference.But what a mess Hallstrom has made! This is the `Harry Potter' school of filmmaking where a book is reduced to the episodes therein and they are marched before us without any sense of the world from which they project. A collection of thin banalities and cute platitudes are substituted, as with his last film.In fact, not a shred of originality or art is allowed to creep in, from the `Prince of Tides' first shot to the obligatory and ordinary helicopter ending. All of the self-reference is lost, except the thin device of Spacey giving some headlines to his life. Nearly all the local peculiarities have been ironed out, even the accents. We are left with a few rugged crags instead. As an example, consider the moving house. I have recently seen three other films with moving buildings, the remarkable `Oscar and Lucinda' (where Cate was allowed to do her rare stuff), `The Widow of St Pierre,' which wasn't novel but lovely, and the underrated `The Claim.'

Successful storytelling is bound by its media, so a successful print story can be only a starting point for cinematic narrative.

His handling of the unseen contrasted with and contained in huge interiors is his strategy and it may have worked better when the film was new. But its just too tame now.What's very nice is the selfreference.

Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible.

There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain.

Filmmakers can simply reference some prefab worlds; viewers need do less work.But there are other paths to alternative worlds, and by themselves they can make interesting films, even if they don't provide much for building a life.One such is this film. It struck me as important in the this \"coherent world\" way when I first saw it in a theater, and I recently revisited it in a poor quality DVD, apparently made from a old tape. It still worked.The story itself is trivial. Though there are some fine character actors, they don't matter at all. The director and composer do well enough. But what matters here is the design of the world, the sight. The production design, art design, set dressers, costumers and even the way the camera is allowed to move through the space matters, not because they do a good job but because they are so attuned. It seems that someone started with the idea of cinematic shadows with agency, and constrained it to a beaux art/ art deco architecture. Even the scenes in Tibet conform to this vision, and make sense in the world we are presented.Tim Burton is often credited with this approach, at least in the \"comic superhero\" world, though I think Warren Beatty led the way. But Burton's worlds are delivered more through the tone of the narrative and score than the actual visuals. Whatever magic the craftspeople were able to spin on this did not stick: none of them were able to create meaningful projects. This itself is not meaningful either.

We have a remote oil rig with two full characters and a handful of surrounding beings.

He is nursed by a character played by Sarah Polley, who has a tortured past.She knows how to work with the purpose of a film, and when that purpose it to turn things over to the actors, she really turns it on. This actually works as intended for the first two thirds, where the narrative doesn't exist and we just settle between these two. The situations and container are extreme, but we tie into the universal emotions that are raised here.Unfortunately, towards the end, narrative takes over and we leave the world of connected emotions and enter the world of a story that must find its end. He, now sighted tracks her down, and appeals to a future in love regardless of the certain pain. This may make for a happy, even acceptable ending, but it is not the experience we invested in.As if to assert that story trumps connectedness, the filmmaker goes the extraordinary distance to tell us how the story ends for every single character we met on that oilrig.

It is from an idea of one of our foremost humorists, himself a cartoonist. There's supposed to be some relationship among the types of cartoons he draws, the fantasies he imagines and the \"real\" story in which he finds himself.All three are presented, but there is a poor relationship made among them.

He had the same job as Bardem's character in \"No Country for Old Men,\" but uses a sledgehammer. He rises in the ranks, assumes the position of mayor and is taken down after an exclusive run where everyone is paid off.Made during prohibition, the movie gives some insight into the makeup of the gangs. Prohibition was mainly a racist, anti-immigrant movement, something like the ugliness we see today. The gangs were a social countermovement with distinctly old world character. So there are two story elements, folded. But the thing is primitive cinematically, and not of interest. But it has one remarkable cinematic puzzle.The gang wins for most of the movie. Law enforcement is thwarted at every turn. Eventually \"the law\" finds its own strategy: bond together as a gang themselves. Thus the \"secret six\" are formed. Presumably, their identities must be kept secret to prevent being rubbed out. Here we have two strange ideas: that it takes a gang to counter a gang, and that secrecy is key. We actually see them twice, which is when the strange thing occurs.These guys are in a room with several \"non-secret\" law enforcement guys. All six wear blindfolds. Now it is obvious why: with cinema still this young, you could get away with this shorthand. It is a device that tells you the nature of the secrecy. It tells you a lot visually. It makes no sense in the real world, none at all. But it is an easily readable cinematic shorthand. We wouldn't allow it today.Building on this is a background character.

Two are suicide-inducingly depressing.But before we get to that, there's always at the beginning the adjustment; you have to know what you are entering.I'm particularly fond of Christian movies. The very idea of them is so intriguing, quite apart from the fact that they are dreadful movies and full of repellent ideas. What makes them so seductive is that they usually depict some fight with the devil, and they are made with the intent of fighting the devil. Its my favorite narrative fold. Entering it is entering an adventure on perhaps the wrong side.Documentaries are boring in this regard: they present, you receive. I like to stay away from them because a large part of the experience for me is the engagement with the weaver of the narrative. Fiction is where it is at. So there's a sort of intrigue with this because it is in a sense an engagement of wills, where they try to convince you that convincing isn't the way of the world.The three threads of this are: Some business about \"attraction\" as the way the world works and how you can use it. More about this spread in future comments. Its a good notion if you ignore how it is presented. Some significantly worse, even smarmy business where they try to make this sound scientific. Its such a depressing enterprise. Its not just that they get the science all wrong, so twisted and goofy. Or that the peddlers of this are so soft you want to cry. But why? Why should it be important to take something that if it works, it works outside of the logical tools we have. Its a bit like explaining with a lawnmower why a house feels good. Quantum mechanics is the current bucket that hacks like to carry their notions in. And its so entirely inappropriate it makes one cry. Why? Why, try this? But the third part is perhaps the most discouraging. I think it is possible to build a notion that works; you'll have to do it by weaving in and around the knuckleheads of various stripes. Its fairly easy to filter out the pseudoscience. But then they pile on a conspiracy theory. You see: not only is there a simple law, and not only is it manifest science, but it has been known for thousands of years by a select few and kept secret!Never mind that we've been told it isn't a zero sum game and people have to lose for others to win. And that selfishness fights the law. And that good results cannot be bounded. There is only one reason to have this notion here, and that is to create a more intriguing story, to make us more likely to buy the \"law.\" But if the law works, they wouldn't need such tricks.

Oh, its nothing particularly deep, but it just seems so pure and right for what they were attempting, which was this notion of transcendent freedom.Ford's idea of the west and therefore America was this business of openness. His cowboy stories usually deal with unhealthy constraint in some way. Here it is kidnapping and racial defilement.

Man searches for them to kill them, so that they don't have to live with the burdens of events.You could imagine all sorts of depth in this, and some watchers have, despite the bluntness of the two principles, and the absolutely childish second plot, childishly done as if it represented the intrusion of the little girl's mind before the captive sex.So I have to admit, that I give this my watchable recommendation.

Not a matter of burnout in his case, but laziness. De Niro still breaths fire, has good rhythm, but with no magic.Norton is not only of a new generation agewise, but a practitioner of a new method, one which fills the narrative space with irony, not the direct perspective of the other two. More sustainable because he can reflect us into the space. De Niro depends on putting himself in that space, and he is just not an interesting enough man to fill the dozens and dozens of roles he passes through.`Fight Club' understood this new method, literally building it into the narrative. The writer and director of this mess have no clue. Brando discovered this on showing up and refused to participate.

Its the 'intelligent design\" illusion, I suppose. Here's a film made 90 some years ago, within the first decade of the real movie business. It was based on an 1850 novel. It is closer in time to that novel than us, which is something of a jolt.And yet, it comes across with such modern ideas about self-reference. If \"Dogville\" wasn't inspired by this, it could have been.You know the story, no doubt: an intolerant mob, led by public figures who obsess about conformity to notions which from a distance are obviously designed to maintain their power. Any deviance is a threat to the community. No more modern theme exists.But it is the manner of the drama that is of interest, in the story and the way it is presented.In the story, a person isn't simply recognized as deviants, they are labeled. They literally wear signs, in the manner of Red Guard placards detailing their sins. (Or Jesus...) We are introduced to this notion early in the movie. The letter in question is such a sign.But there are others as well. The minister who is haunted acts in the most dramatic way, clutching his heart constantly. This is not only for us, the viewers, but for his love. At one point the daughter asks why the minister is always clutching his heart and then makes fun of it.However, the way the thing is presented to us is the same: a collection of labeled episodes. Each one begins with an appearance and then labels itself. Often the labeling for us and for the townspeople overlap. In some of these cases, there is a stage, notably at the end, where our on screen audience bows their head as we are intended to do.There's no tenderness here, only expositions of tenderness.

Often its fictional or fictionalized love stories that are in the movie itself. But much more fascinating are the love stories that drive the movie, and for me, the most engaging of these are when a director, directs an actress (usually and actress) with whom he is in love  and sleeping with.Sometimes it is subtle, but often not  the way the camera lingers, the way the staging is manipulated, the way the situations are bent in the service of love. The least interesting of these engagements is simple worship, as we have here. But in this case its so extreme it has its own charm.The story is that there was a mundane but driven filmmaker, a copyist, and a pretty actress with adventuresome sexuality who coupled. This transformed them both and film along the way.She developed a stage persona for him, and he leveraged her and his cinematic worship of her into a career. This was their greatest adventure, probably because after 6 years, he had to do something extreme. We benefit. Now this movie is horrible in all the non-worship parts: the acting, the story are miserable. The score is effective but simply bombastic.Its all the visuals that are amazing. Some of this is cinematic in nature, meaning related to the camera itself: lights, placement, movement, occlusion. But the key thing is her face  never her body  in the context of these bizarre images and settings. We start with a child, then explicitly sexual torture, then highly eroticized ripeness. These images set the tone for the larger situation: the entry into the perverted reality of Russia. She enters this strange, demented version of the church, with odd gargoyles in ordinary rooms, with immense spaces and gigantic doors, everything twisted a bit. Its based on images and setups from Eisenstein's Ivan films. It leverages the fear we've always had about their strange religion, and their dark sexual intrigues.Against this, we have three sexual phases starting with the erotic innocent, whose wondering eyes the camera hypnotically explores. Then we have the open sexual opportunist, the schemer, the favor provider.And finally the triumphant hedonist, the white furry goddess whose sexual confident stride charms a nation.They aren't the roles or context I would have chosen.

World War II is the first that includes new technologies of all types and is the first where movies become important. Movies and cinematic pageant were used by the Germans to define their new culture and unify vision. The Americans and British responded with amazing energy.Now go back a bit. Victorian England experienced a huge schism of worlds, similar to what is happening in America today. On the one hand, you had the spiritualist movement and a bogus science of \"paranormal\" stuff: spirits, seances, magic. Arthur Conan Doyle was the most public promoter of the these notions, which he infused with the vague smell of science.On the other hand, you had Darwin and a host of other scientists that were revealing the machinery, the logical machinery, of the world. Everything it seemed had a mechanical, predictable explanation. No divinity it seemed. No magic. Conan Doyle was also a talisman of this thread. He created Sherlock as a sort of cartoon, a thinking machine that could deduce human behavior.It was a bit extreme and hit a sweet spot in the public. Conan Doyle actually came to resent the character, actually killed him at one point. But the meme has grown a whole literary and cinematic family tree, all based on the notion of discovered narrative.By the time of the War, the Brits had adopted and adapted Sherlock as a sort of national identity. Cool, determined, still a master of logic but human. Watson is transformed from a dispassionate transcriber to a comic buffoon, also important to the national character.This story is not from Conan Doyle, but follows the \"Hound\" rather closely with the addition of the element of an actor. In Hound, the murderer was acting like a ghost. Here, he is as well but is literally an actor who takes on several human disguises as well. It is a peculiarly cinematic notion of folding: an actor acting as an actor acting as several people, on both sides of this Conan Doyle split.Incidentally, the \"Lord Penrose\" here in his occult society is deliberately a copy of Conan Doyle.The story employs non of the deductive miracles of the books. Actually, this man might as well have been any Scotland Yard inspector.So this is a strange thing. It is derived from Sherlock without being genuinely Sherlock. It captures all the insider references that make it intelligent. It is produced as a sort of horror movie way. The inside of Penrose's house is extraordinary. Except for the ending, it is well made. It is set in Canada with a bit of hidden disdain for the French speakers.

Here's a much less obvious one, and it may be hard to see why.Superficially it is a slight project, a slim entertainment in a common form: a genre film that references the established notions of western justice that has in the standard interstices a story of racial justice earned. (You have to imagine that in those days it was commonly accepted that the black \"man\" had  by dint of intense perseverance  finally achieved a place at the table. Also, you have to place yourself in a place where the western was still taken seriously and without irony as the zone where American values were handled, reaffirmed.)Its not obvious today, because notions of race have since shifted.

They have a large hand in creating reality for us, and so we give them personalities just like we do to religious forces.So we have the comedy and noir and so on which often take on the same sorts of stereotypical characteristics we give to people. At some point, clever filmmakers, writers and actors started playing off the stereotypes of the film genre as they had been for decades with character stereotypes. Then after a long string of films that had films in them in different roles, David Lynch came along and made a film which consists of two film genre stereotypes battling it out: `Blue Velvet.' The Capra goodness becomes a film Mother nature and an evil noirish thriller type becomes a Satanic deity. They battle for control over what is on the screen, what is in our minds. (The end is a draw.) The actors and characters are mere tokens for the larger battle between two metacharacters.That reinvented the world of possibilities for clever writers, and every one is now trying some sort of battle between film stereotypes that happens behind the scenes. And in doing so, they often play a common dirty trick on the actors involved. Actors are relatively stupid about the big picture because they have to have extraordinary focus on what they do. Their concerns are just different than the filmmakers. So we have a growing practice of filmmakers taking advantage of the cluelessness of the actor in a particular role.We have, for instance Harrison Ford in `Bladerunner.' He's the kind of actor that is genuinely stupid and as a person has no idea of the forces that control his life. Scott puts him in a character where that underpinning, though subtle, helps make the film a masterpiece. The Cohens do this a lot, and the practice is spreading as a major extension of typecasting.Now we have this clever film, `Salton Sea,' that goes halfway toward the film type battle by investing the battle in two method actors, Kilmer and D'Onofrio. One lives in a Tarantino (actually Welles) film, the other in an Aronofsky (actually Tarkovsky) film. Kilmer pretends to be in the Pooh Bear film as a personal conspiracy, consistent with Tarantino-like motives. The `mystery' is in where all the surrounding characters fall, in which film, and ultimately with which film will `win.'Following the Lynch formula (Gayton and Caruso are clever but no artists) the end is a merger of the two film types. Chaos meets self-destruction.I imagine that Caruso worked hard to balance the two film genres, probably talking to each actor separately. Probably keeping a scorecard: one `thriller' plot twist = one comic drug hallucination.Along the way, we get a few self-referential devices. These are also requirements of this new form: a reference to Zapruder -- a film that supports two truths and by extension the fabricated documentary of Stone and his plastic realities. A reference to Bob Hope's crap (read: films) and a plot to coopt it. Lot's of references to other films: `Do you feel lucky?' A `performance' within: Guzman and Unger work their own little embedded film. Another: Kujo creates his own embedded heist film.Its all fun if you love movies. A little sad to see Kilmer's commitment taken advantage of so, but that's the tragedy of the thing. These guys are doomed to unhappy lives unless they cease to act, like DeNiro.\nIt's a fun and clever example of a new type of synthesized, self-referential film, but there's nothing new or particularly lifealtering here.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw0707060"},{"movie":"Helgonet gör razzia","heading":"Accidentally Bad","date":"13 October 2004","content":"Spoilers herein.There are a few things I really enjoy in thinking about film.

It has been rejected from IMDb a few times now. It celebrates the exploration of the visual vocabulary over the traditional values of what is often called the story. The story in 2012 is lacking, according to several of these traditional measures.Okay. Here is a film that has those story values solidly. The only thing it is lacking is poetry in the lines. But the story itself is powerful and complex. Warriors are off, on both a spiritual quest and to provide for their partners. The women, left at home worry when they are late, so set out themselves, their own bodies on the line in a parallel spiritual/sexual quest. They know — or suspect through legend — that this involves a sea voyage through the watery lair of the vortex monster, a combination of phallic aggression and vaginal engulfing. Yes, friends, this story would be seen as deeply rooted as anything that Star Wars mined (at least initially). They do find their men. They do rescue them from the \"caves.\" The general background is weft by some foreground fables:— an effeminate man of privilege is tested, found to be unworthy and is killed. His corpse is tossed into a decidedly less passionate vaginal orifice, together with a sex slave of notably discardable value. Meanwhile, a similarly effeminate Viking fellow accompanies the Viking women. He has been left behind by the real men. Short and meek, he is tested, found worthy and wins the tallest and most sexually selective of the Amazonians.— one of the women — \"the dark one\" — is treacherous. She casts the deciding vote to go on the quest to gain some advantage over her rival in the pulchritude pecking order. She indeed beds the king of the capturers and gains the upper hand for a while, increasing the plight of her countryfellows. But she is redeemed in the end, sacrificing her body so the others can be free. (This actress has a fascinating personal history that mirrors this role.)— the \"king\" here is more carefully crafted than a stereotype. He is costumed in the fashion of Buck Rogers' Ming, carrying a generic exoticism that cinematically evokes (at least in me) subterranean repression. He acts the part as if he is in those serials, a jailer created by fear of actually being whole.Well, anyway, the story has heft. All else is crappy: effects and other production values.

So many of these were intelligently framed. You decide:We meet a man on the street who has just taken drugs. He gazes into a shop window and the statues of nude women become real. He then wanders down the street and into a movie theater. He watches first a feature on a nudist camp  standard fare in those days. Then begins a second movie whose titles are presented the same way as the one WE are watching. Every few minutes we shift from this movie within to the guy in the theater, just watching.Okay, the movie within is of a fellow knocked cold by an automobile accident caused by our Wanda, an ultratall woman who is the leader of a gang of women hedonists. She takes our hapless Sylvester to her home, where he is whipped, bound, screwed and ultimately hypnotized.Meanwhile, a sex maniac has escaped from the local \"funny farm.\" The radio warns us that he is a sex-crazed maniac who (the radio tells us) goes berserk with drugs. This fellow  wearing a coat that says \"State Fun-ee Farm\"  shows up at Wanda's, where else? He seems to be the same guy watching in the theater, who, I think is the writer/director.Hmm, starts to get interesting. He invades, whipping the girls and holding them at gunpoint. Sex, naturally. He frees the captive driver and together the two men find the LSD  a bottle marked \"LSD\" in inch high letters. Everyone takes it and what they see is the last 15 minutes but five.The maniac is then returned to the loony bin, the motorist (Sylvester, hypnotized into forgetting) is returned to his repaired Buick. Our moviegoer leaves the theater, enters his car, runs over nails set by Wanda and is kidnapped like Sylvester was.In all this, it is ambiguous whether what we see is an ordinary movie, the movie within, the moviegoer's drug vision, or that of Sylvester, or (strong hints here) we have all been hypnotized by Wanda.Finally, the importance of the film  if you follow these things  is in the acid vision itself. There's now a long tradition of this, filming transcendental vision. The same techniques are used whether psychotropic or math or mad dreams, but this was early in its invention.

I thought each deviation from the ordinary was obvious and trivial, the kind of thing a clever film student would do if sponsored for a few decades and never challenged beyond that first callow vision. I wrote a comment saying so. I attach it below, unchanged. I rated it a 2, which for me says it is not worth watching unless you study movies, in which case it has something in it worth thinking about or experiencing.In the year since then, I experienced Maddin's \"Dracula\" and was knocked back. Really knocked back. The eye moves, the camera moves, the dancers, the story. The story moves away from the Dracula story we know. All of them dance with one another in deliberate, designed ways. This is a master here, I realized.But quite independent of this, I was appreciating and refining my original \"Saddest\" experience. A film experience is partly during the time your eye receives it. But your mind often receives it for months afterward. Sure, you may fall in love with something that you largely create. But that's the nature of art, to inject something that you and the artist build around collaboratively. The trick is to create a seed that attracts nourishment and creates something beautiful when in bloom.Recently, I revised my list of \"fours,\" films I think you really must see. No more than two per year or two from any filmmaker arrive on my list of fours. To my amazement, this is on that list.The things I remember fondly are way he plays with the nature of perception. To make this easier for you than for me, I suggest you consider the character created by de Medeiros as a sort of dream narrator. Love, sex, song, and a redefined notion of fulfillment.Joyce famously tried in \"Finnegans Wake\" to create a genuine dream world, one where the images didn't matter as much as the way they were bent and smeared. We have that here. Or at least I did, eventually.Original comment:Camera Obscura, My Tapeworm SaysI pride myself as an explorer of cinematic worlds. No territory is too exotic, no cosmology too esoteric, no passion out of bounds. Mere competence is not enough, nor coherence and consistency sufficient to create a world worth living in.Lynch, Greenaway, Gilliam, Svankmeyer, Quay each in their own way imagine things first cinematic ally and then on that frame, in that world, embellish with all the things we actually see. The experience is first with the world they see that wouldn't. Then and only then do we start to unravel the logic of the images, story and such.Not here. I'm sad to say that Maddin isn't worth exploring. You may find his stylistic exuberance fulfilling by itself. But it has no world rooting it, he seems content to use the ordinary, tiresome world as if he were an editorial cartoonist. And that's the problem. This isn't a venture into an unfamiliar imagination, merely an offbeat skit, intended as a jape.This man isn't interested in sorrow, which is no crime. Instead he is interested in political commentary on ordinary emotions.There is a redeeming element: Maria de Medeiros creates one of the most interesting characters I have ever seen. The story duly supports this creation, and that's noble enough a reason to exist I suppose.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.","id":"rw1393491"},{"movie":"The Rum Diary","heading":"Accusatory Giblet","date":"2 June 2012","content":"I have no idea whether powerful art requires pain in the creator. I suspect not. But it is an unhappy fact that the actors that I appreciate must be seriously incomplete when not acting. Sean Penn and Robert Downey are the most interesting living (male) actors in my universe, but Depp comes close.We all need a story to live in, to come home to and what fascinates is how focused these stories seem to be. You don't need to identify with a token being to adopt their story, and I would not say that Depp *identifies* with Thompson. But then Thompson himself was reaching for something, someone beyond. So when Depp strives to be in the smell of the Hunter, it is the smell being hunted — scents all the way down.For a very long time, Depp has publicly admired Thompson and performed what rituals a powerful actor can. Among them is this film, which I come to as something in between reading an interview wherein Depp presents his target narrative and a film intended to have agency as an independent story. As a standalone film, it is an utter failure — excepting a few lines and fewer images. The intended mood is never attained. Of all of Gilliam's failures, the one success he had was the ability to create the man's trace or order through fog (in 'Fear and Loathing').But I will still recommend this, because the man openly carries his persona to his successful roles. Neither we nor he know just what that persona really is. But we do know what he wants it to be.

I value filmmakers who do something unique in terms of narrative placement, who enlist their actors to the same end they see (a rare thing), and who cleverly employ self-reference. But the tone is too flat for me, and the mechanics too visibly artificial. But those mechanics are expertly engineered:1). Engineered Self-referential Irony. the creating duo on this film want to make flat, simple comic-book episodes. As literally designs on royal playing cards. That's a matter of design. In recognition of this, they decide to make their approach a specific part of the film: Margot's plays are a mirror of what this is: kids in animal costumes with no character development. She has a dry period (actually wet, in a bathtub) and then after the action of this film, writes it as a play, which is presumably what we see.\nRichie, who has always loved her, also wishes to be an artist. We see his art: it is also representative of the film's deliberate style: sketchy, minimal, `folk art.' This is the same art that illustrates the book we see that titles episodes. In other words, the film is Margot's words and Richie's pictures. The actual writers tell us this is their style.2). Engineered Casting. This is filmmaking in the Altman/PT Anderson tradition, but not as skillful. In this philosophy, you sketch a story thinly and let your actors find their characters and chemistry. It is all in the casting. And I must admire the skill with which this cast is engineered. Hackman is a type of actor that finds all his characters within himself. Which makes him `natural,' but has the undesired effect of always showing the same avuncular dope. All the men actors are of this internal type. They are always letting you know that they are acting, sometimes winking.The women! Angelica Huston is one of the most intelligent actress working. She is not a glamourgirl so doesn't get many roles. But she so far outclasses Hackman, it is the source of an in joke. I have no doubt that Hackman has no clue, and probably wouldn't care if he knew he was being goofed on.Gwyneth is growing as a real actress -- not like any of these guys -- someone who reaches outside for someone and adapts her soul. In this, you can visibly see her taking Huston's lead. This was a very clever choice which pays off well in the one central scene: after the suicide attempt in the tent with Richie. She's the writer, its clear.I saw Gwyneth do something similar in \"Duets,\" a similar unconstrained situation. Its what you come up with when the director is weak that really shows who you are. She may become someone that matters. We can hope.And the narrator! This fantasy is of the type pioneered for the masses by Tim Burton. So we get it framed by the Beetlejuice guy.3). Engineered Music. Here's the most skilled part of the construction: All the music is old, from the 60s-70s. Beatles, Stones, Dylan, Morrison. Including a really cool insertion: the `Pat Garrett' theme, `Knocking on Heaven's Door.' One song from `Satanic Majesty's.' This stuff is from such a far away era (I hate to say) that it adds to the pretend nature of the skit.","id":"rw0770873"},{"movie":"The Rocketeer","heading":"Wasn't Lies, it was Acting","date":"19 February 2003","content":"Spoilers herein.Nearly all films are about other films.

I feel this way when I go to these mundane time-fillers. But there are a few layers worthy of attention we can see from a height.The first is the style itself. Cartoonists are like other filmmakers in that they stand in the footprints of those who went before. Their palette is one of quotes and references but with the references particularly noticable. Here, the directors chose to depict a legendary quasi-place and chose to make it like Pepperland of `Yellow Submarine' fame. The water effects are wholly new, but that is a matter of emerging technology, and of course we have pyramids. But once the heros arrive in the fabled city, it is all Pepperland (and the opening credits as well). Interesting. I suppose the reference is from the fabulous nature of the places and not the use of hallucinogens by the Maya. Except, well except the treatment given of the priest's magic which is wholly psychotropic.Another observation is the evolving exploitation of exotic cultures in kiddie fare. Africa (in `Lion King' and `Tarzan'), the Mideast (in `Aladdin' and the Moses thing), India (in the Kipling thing I didn't see) and Algonquian America have all taken their turn at neocolonialism, reinvention of truth, and propagation of stereotypes. But here we have a new, rather interesting insult.The Spanish perpetuated the greatest genocide in history until then by killing 2/3 of South and Central America just for gold (and crazy religion). (This was the worst in history until the Belgians killed 10 million Africans in their greed for rubber.) By the time of the First English colony, the Spanish had already imported a million Africans as slaves, because the Maya and other indigenous people didn't make good slaves. Today, in Mexico, the Maya still resist assimilation after over four hundred years. Now, the Mexicans are the cruel oppressors, still with the Spanish language, religion and governmental system.So much remarkable (and even entertaining) could be said of/shown about these people (who still don't even speak Spanish). But what do we get? The characters are Mexicans! We won't know the difference, right? But wait, it gets worse, Rosie Perez isn't Mexican but Puerto Rican, and in fact was born and raised in New York City. So we have a presumably real West Side `watchagonnado boutit' person standing for a Mexican cartoon, standing for the European Hispanic stereotyped woman (big legs, big boobs, big lips), standing for a Maya.

But first let me describe a hobby of mine. I'm particularly attracted to minigenre: sets of sequels like the Alien films for instance or remakes or copies. I learn more about film by looking at these than any other exercise. That's because the differences are slight but obvious. For instance \"Eat Drink Man Woman\" is excellent but the same script as \"Tortilla Soup\" was a disaster.No film in recent memory provides more fodder than \"Ringu.\" There's the original of course, then the US remake, two Japanese sequels and a prequel, this US sequel, and two US copies \"Grudge\" and Boogeyman.\"Each of these uses the same trick, sometimes in different forms: the thing that haunts is related to the medium you are engaged in by merely watching. As long as you watch, there is no escape. The original does this in spades. Successive versions are weaker because they necessarily add more story. And it is not story that we need, it is the attention to the form of the story. More story content weakens the form.In this particular case, the story literally breaks the form: the evil is no longer constrained to the film within the film.

Horror is an especially interesting case. In quick succession, we have had `Blair Witch' in which the tape and film embodied the evil and the act of filming brought it into being. That was followed by the even more clever `Witch 2' where the realities of video and film were separate and warring for control over there mere humans. In the following year we had four slasher films which employed the making of slasher films in their plot in varying degrees of reflexive sophistication.And now we have this which pulls out all the stops. In this version, a character supernaturally creates the video. The video plays a marvelously multipurpose role: as a film within a film, as the charm which saves the boy, as the charm which both contains and summons the spirit of the girl, and the useful device of showing it all to us.Along the way, we have heavy use of cinematic icons: water, the ring/well, the tree, the horses, the TeeVee. There is some skillful camerawork and clever use of height in the well and the barn attic room. Naomi Watts stars in her second film of this type where a character creates what we see and what we see is blurred with `reality.'The story is relatively simple: the intrusion of the film-within on the world of the `basic' film, starting with a fly within the video entering the world of the watcher. It all proceeds according to a pretty clear logic with Naomi entering the world of the girl (and vice versa) by steps until we see the daughter conflated with her son. The only breaking of the rules are those darned telephone calls.But the rest is from the self-reference playbook: the husband works in the film business, the wife in the `reporter' business. The sign of impeding death in the blurred camera. The whole mystery is unraveled by finding and looking at newspapers and videos.I saw this under the very best of circumstances: in an audience of about two hundred midteenagers at the 7:30 show. They came in groups sufficiently large to make them unruly and vocal. The swell and movement within the theater was extraordinary, which brings up a quandary fro the filmmakers. The self-reference of the story works best when this will be rented by small groups of teens for showing at home, and the larger market these days is rentals over the theatrical run. But the effect within a theater is notable. Clearly, they have their eye on the rental market because many of the effects could have leveraged the big screen at least as well as the original, especially when contrasting between the contained video and and video taking over the screen.

Less, this film has less sex than necessary for the cinematically effective.\nWhat makes this the best Vampire story? The book was written as a journal of a scientific mind, but one that may be becoming increasingly untrustworthy, like the much later `Lolita.' It is essential to preserve that distance.

That's because a cornerstone of film narrative is the game between the filmmaker and viewer, conventions from the detective story.So it rankles me when good stuff in the source material gets bleached out in a movie version because someone somewhere didn't understand what they had. The Granada Holmes project is a huge offender in this regard. They follow TeeVee convention which says that the characters are the thing, that situations consist not of logical ambiguities, but of attractive places. And then when a \"solution\" is reached it is just fine to surprise the viewer, that there is no connection between the detection and the conclusion. These Granada projects follow the BBC production technique of assigning a different creative team to each project. So within the approach of \"faces and places\" you get different styles. I've given all that background to say that one of the episodes in this collection breaks the rules and actually produces a very fine experience. Just this one; the rest is amusing trash.The episode in question is \"The Abbey Grange,\" which has the happy coincidence of an adapter who understands what mystery narrative is all about and a director who understood his writer. So we get a quite effective translation of Conan Doyle. We have images early in the episode that we see that don't make sense, we experience comprehension bit by bit as images emerge from that darkness. These two techniques seem trite, but they work amazingly well. And they accommodate Brett's translation of the character. His Holmes is tightly wound as is the written Holmes. But Brett insists on some explosive theatrics to make the point; it shows he trusts our intelligence little when he does it so frequently. Brooding and mechanical and deeply selfish would be harder to portray, but would be so much more effective.The sweet spot of the stories came from the fact that Holmes was inhuman in most respects. And that to the consternation of the reader, he repeatedly demonstrates that people are more machines than human, that they can be sussed out every time  excepting the few evil geniuses.

My primary value is in the exploration of selfreferential storytelling. That's where the story in the film is about the story of the film. The filmmakers have surrogates. The film is represented therein by a show or writing of some kind.Another thing that I value is the self-aware, active camera. That's one that participates in the action. Clearly, this an the self-referential construction can support each other. But the cinematic camera can go places not reducable in narrative terms.The third thing surprised me. I've become enchanted with the role that redheaded women play in film. I believe their use can carry significant power, and that some sophisticated entanglement between reflecting and creating society is at work.Well, this film has all three. It has a lovely redhead. She is the subject of the film and also the creator of the show within the show. She is the focus of the motion around her and the generator of motion which illuminates all. The film can be seen as her own fairytale, beginning in her dream with her in princess garb going up that marvelous stairway. And she is absolutely enchanting until the end where she has to act and can't quite pull it off. But she is photographed as a person with a loving lens.And this film is deeply, deeply self-referential. I think it springs from the similarly structured, French `Children of Paradise,' of a couple years prior. The initial backstage scenes are strikingly similar as well. `Who's in charge?' The important similarities are the focus for multiple control over a girl, the nesting of performance within the performance and the mixing of the creation of the film with the creation of the performances displayed. The Hungarian producer has a surrogate in the impresario played by a Hungarian, the director in the composer. The girl is an actress, a character as dancer and the character within the dance. All three are cursed by the strength of the story to take over the reality in which it is placed. I love this stuff.But there's more: this is the first time to my knowledge where the camera self-consciously enters the action, changes reality, even creates new frames of reality> The camera dances. The camera allows the dancer and magical shoes to create their own realities. The camera is never a static audience, even in the framing sections that come before and after the ballet.

Townspeople know what is up, take their bibles and guns to kill the girl and are thwarted. Now it is up to Hilary's character. Magical storms swirl as they confront each other and the child seems doomed at the \"angel's\" hand. But then Hilary's angel character has a revelation. The child is God's angel. Most of the town are satanists. Like \"Wicker Man,\" Hilary had been selected to be tricked into murdering the girl. Seems that all the satanists are first-borns and for some complex reason they cannot kill the child; only someone who has lost all faith can.But Hilary's character sees the truth, lets the girl go and the last plague is visited: death to the firstborn. It is actually a pretty good reversal on paper. The effects and the stereotypical, unimaginative settings ruin it all.

Both are celebrated. Both seem to understand Kate's gift as an actress  that she is one of those rare players who can convey what a character does and also, via another channel, what she thinks or rather what motivates what she does. Its what I've called folded acting, with that second layer being a direct communication with the audience that annotates the first.Its a specific sort of openness, and usually a filmmaker asks her to be obviously open. Both of these men, understanding this, have asked her to do the opposite. She is instead, obviously closed, using that second channel to convey that the channel is there but much is hidden.Both of these films are amazing on this count. Its a new development in film acting in the 50 years or so since folded acting first emerged.But otherwise, oh, what a difference in the two films. The \"Revolutionary\" one is made by her husband apparently just for this one effect. There is no narrative structure, only a stunt. The music is the main character there.This film is wonderfully structured. It as rich in narrative facets as she is, each reinforcing the other. Seeing the two close to each makes me wonder why it isn't obviousThe film starts with us being told that literature, great literature is about hidden information. Then, throughout, we have the thread of the law, both referencing classroom and trial genres except for the focus on what is not revealed. This is folded into the very literature itself that is denied this woman, except in three circumstances: one we hear about and two we see.And THAT is folded into love, its unrelenting yearning that can gnaw, its sex (obsessively, Germanically clean) and its idealistic romances. Both Chekhov and Homer as the templates. Wow, what care!Its a matter of all choices having been discovered and not made. About what daughters do not know. Lena Olin has a career high here playing two generations. Her portrayal of the daughter is profound. We never really understand what happened with her: her mother was the only survivor of a specific situation. It seems that the daughter was born after the war and wrote a book about her mother's plight, never escaping the story.Its all about observing, observing in every dimension and the power of looking even when you cannot seem to see.At the end, there is a remarkable contrast between Hanna's stark cell, indeed everything in Germany we are shown as stark, and the opulent home of the daughter. There, she reminds that illiteracy is not a Jewish problem  this is after literature has been conflated with life.There is a pretty, sexy law student with whom our lad sleeps. She may have become his wife and that one evening the origin of the other daughter. She is played by the same actress who was the Plum Girl in \"Perfume,\" the original womanscent.The role of a certain church is deliberately kept ambiguous. It may in fact be the church that we visit twice. We never really learn what happened there, and its significantly shrouded. That will always be hidden.The same fellow who made this also made the similarly deep \"The Hours\" and the execrable feel good trailer trash \"Billy Elliot.\" Go figure.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw2013776"},{"movie":"Buster på spår","heading":"The Straight Story","date":"8 October 2005","content":"in 1999, David Lynch made an apparently simple film about a man traveling across the country on a lawn mower.

The control was amazing, simply amazing.I'm sure he had this partly in mind. Here we have an old guy, also dying of cancer, traveling across the land in a similar vehicle. The genre is comic but the tone is the same: a lone man in the midst of vast nature.Its a sad time though. The man we watch was a genius, someone who invented a huge portion of how we think in film.

Ford knows how to frame, but all is in service to that simple dramatic value of Griffith. I am especially unattracted to Irish films dominated by the overbearing romanticism of Irish Americans. This film is as patronizing as 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' of only a couple years later. One wouldn't have a glimmer from this that the Irish are the best storytellers in the world and their stories are characterized less by the broad childish sweeps shown here, but subtlety, ambiguity and self-reference - in short all the things that the Welles tradition followed in reaction to the traditions of Ford. Not until 'Barry Lyndon' do we in the world of film get Ireland back.But I do appreciate Ms O'Hara. Not as an actress, but as an icon. She owes her fame to Technicolor, which exaggerated her red hair. As she was one of the first big redhead stars in color, she helped established a film archetype. Together with Katherine Hepburn, she defined a notion of independent strength, sex suborned to character, unexpected wisdom, a red mother earth of sorts. This also defined one of the prefabbed pigeonholes we snap to in our own personal relationships. So revisiting these films is a visit into our own history and selves.Until the last 15 minutes, she is one character: proud, independent, sexy. In that last fifteen minutes she asserts her independence and is violently interrupted by her Yankee thug husband, beaten, dragged roughly through sheep dung in front of the entire village (no small insult). He then extorts the money which forms the one plot thread, burns it in contempt, beats her brother (shown as a noble, even admired contest), and then comes home drunk with the brother and rudely demands dinner.

Greene created something of an industry in writing stories that exploit this notion, stories where some moral dilemma is mirrored in huge political or natural tides. It is a simple, unsophisticated idea, but one that sometimes created spellbinding stories as he moved between levels.\nThe effect was one of seamless integration, adding apparent new depth at each level. Never was the depth real, however. Never were there any actual new insights on the larger or personal dynamics. But we went along because of the sheer audacity of the idea and the skill by which it was exploited. Now along comes another film of one of his books, and another failure at this seamless integration. In the book, the forces that unfold are as fluid as the imagination can make them, but with film we are limited by what we can see.So we see war and intrigue. And we see a simple competition of two aliens for the attention of a woman, all with mutual exploitation in mind. Yes, there are a few metaphors (Vietnam as mistress to an aging Europe), but the cosmos of the personal is wholly unrelated to that of the political, except that each happens to be there. This completely drains the project of life and all we are left with is a workmanlike picture with professional but uninspired and unintegrated souls.One element of that workmanship was notable: the rhythm of Caine's delivery. Like any low class English actor of his generation, he is obsessed with subtle nuances in inflection and how that denotes social standing. Here he employs an amazingly effective trick: his timing is rushed a tiny amount, even when giving the voice-over narration. This is a well-established phenomenon in conversational pecking orders: the dominant speaker always has this aggressive timing. Fraser takes this and delays his timing to an equally subtle extent (but less consistently), making him the `quieter' of the two.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw0755559"},{"movie":"Snabbare än döden","heading":"Premodern Values, Postmodern Attempt","date":"31 March 2004","content":"Spoilers herein.Every couple years, somebody takes another whack at bettering the post postmodern western, or whatever they think the champion is.

That beginning bit begins withe her being imaged for public exposure and then looking directly at the camera as if to say: this, this is the portrait of me.She is one of two queens in the story, the other being the ghost of Diana who is shown only in reference and only in public exposure.The official queen is shown at home, watching TeeVee, and frumping around the estate. The story is a rather gauzy one. Part of it is the delving into deviance of (usually English) society, the one thing Frears does well in the middle of his movies. In this case we see the inexplicable business of a monarchy which exists solely to keep a national story suspended. The story is threatened and some sort of a national crisis is averted. Its engaging because every viewer will have lived through that period and this gives peeks into corners we may have wondered about at the time.A second component of the movie is the supposed examination of character of this woman, and the huzzas that Mirren gets for her portrayal. We celebrate the performance only because the movie as a whole works. I can think of a dozen Mirren performances that are better suited to celebration. Ho hum. We see her grieve more for an animal than for Diana, act more out of fear than honor. We see Blair  our designated observer in the story  superficially evolve.A third component has to do with the introspection in the thing. And that is the only bit I can recommend (other than the opening which it supports). The deal is all about story. Nations require a story so they can know who they are. The Brits aren't the most ridiculous people on the planet, but they are the ones who have most explored the foibles of their own national story in their art, so their introspection makes them appear more silly than the rest of us.That national story includes the necessity of actors, so they hire a few nitwits to dress up and pretend to be monarchs. They are simply actors, no more. So the deal with this film is that we have an actress, Mirren, playing an actress who examines her role. Its a meaty opportunity and thank god we didn't get Dench, who I suppose would have been shoehorned in if not for her appearance. And it isn't that Mirren isn't intelligent enough to be an actor that shows how acting works. But Frears isn't interested and Mirren's style is more about showing her commitment to the role rather than exploring our commitment to it.But that opening.

Quantum mechanics is clerical work; it is quantum logic (or whatever you choose to call the principles when divorced from physics) that is where the mysteries lay.

Each project adopts a different set of ideas he finds, so the whole body of work is a sort of encyclopedia of notions about self-reference and folding. In a way, what films you like are determined by what set of ideas you use in your own home world of film. This one is often compared to `Sherlock Jr,' where a projectionist enters the world of film. There is a framing element of that notion here, with Mia's fantasies.

They made no adjustments whatever in the character's mannerisms, and the staging.The result is a dreadfully ineffective movie. The only time it works is when we see the show within the show, the \"Springtime for Hitler.\" Alas, less time is given to this than in the original movie. Really, almost nothing works. One or two of Lane's facial reactions and his number in jail. All else is a horrible mistake in terms of the production decisions.The other deadly element is the gay humor. The 68 original was based on this too, but in those days queers were considered fair game, as were blacks. Since this one broadens all the jokes, the gay jokes are more extreme. Yes, I know that the \"gay community\" thinks it is all in good fun, and the show is amazingly successful.But it still strikes me as ironic that in defusing the holocaust (against Jews, Gypsies and gays) with humor, that humor is based on what are essentially antigay attitudes.

This last is where nearly all movie comedies fall down, and where this one succeeds.We have a couple masters at being funny just being: they are allowed to create skits that are manic. This is great stuff that Brooks let his guys run with. Even within the skits, there are levels: Wilder as observer, Leo Bloom. (The James Joyce joke is intended, as was the Kafka.)But the master touch was the story itself: a play about a play with all the action inbetween the two layers. Part of the layering is the deal about the writer of both the play and the film as Nazi. Brooks would never again be as clever, or as willing to personally be the butt of the joke.But there's price behind this joke. The gag is supposed to be the same as in Chaplin's `The Dictator:' preening evil as ridiculous. Brooks wants to be seen as edgy and on topic both, but watch what he really does in the story, the stuff that is apart from the comic geniuses of Mostel and Wilder.He pokes fun at gays. Incessantly. This sort of undermines the counternazism, doesn't it?He has a mild but pervasive blue humor: the svedish secretary, the horny old birds.He makes fun of Germans in a borrowed `Hogan's Heros' way, but not for their ideas or politics.

Some of these are simply through emulation: using old story and acting conventions, perhaps even old cameras, sets film stock and so on. Others visit the past in more clever and indirect ways. \"Goodnight and Good Luck\" was a thoroughly modern picture set fifty years ago and wearing that era like a costume. Gosh, now that I think, there are too many to list, each interesting in what they choose to use from the past and how they use them as objects or environments.Now this. Here's a case where the movie is a strange disappointment if you watch movies for the story as the direct carrier of its intent. Its confused beyond what the normal viewer can tolerate and where the filmmaker intends ambiguity and tension we get the impression the film is a failure. But it isn't; it is wholly realized, its just that the message is conveyed on the telephone wires next to the track instead of on the train.The story: a woman has ten kids and a husband who is a mean drunk. She's completely on her own; her priest (she's Catholic, obviously) and the local police buddy up to her husband against her. She's bright so she enters contests  a previously popular advertising gimmick  and wins enough to save her family (always at the very last moment) from certain disaster. The woman is played by Julianne Moore, and superficially she creates a woman who is defiantly happy no matter what. No matter what, even after negotiating charity from the milkman, then having her lousy spouse push her down breaking all the milk and seriously cutting her. Smiles still  to the hospital and back. So if you stick with the story, defiance is in her attitude and the prize is this sainthood granted her by her children, one of whom writes the thing.The narrative experiment and happy, happy gloss is established well before we know she's cursed by what feminists would rebel against. And its that narrative structure that you will find interesting.Julianne's character is the narrator. Often, she looks directly at the camera and speaks to us. Sometimes, she is on screen twice; once as the narrator and again oblivious to the fact she is being spoken about. This notion is extended by a gimmick. Her contests mostly are posed on TeeVee shows and there's a lot of overlap in several different ways between TeeVee space and narrator space. That narrator space gets pretty big; One example: our narrator explains how contests are judged. She sits on an envelope and flies to New York, following the entry. Another: she wins a sandwich slogan contest and the sandwich literally comes out of the screen with three dancing women in pastel dresses (like that of our heroine). They commingle with the narrator-TeeVee-contest space which by that time we've accepted as her private refuge from reality. Later, the house becomes populated not with actors playing the ten children, but the actual children themselves, now grown of course. In this sequence we see the daughter who wrote the book take her mom's typewriter.Its scads more sophisticated than say, what Woody Allen did in \"Purple Rose of Cairo.\" But it reads.And it works  if you allow it  because Julianne knows how to place two persons in one role, what I call folded acting; two skins one hers and one ours.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw1560121"},{"movie":"Privatögat privat","heading":"Tamer Wilder","date":"1 January 2007","content":"I like the fantasy of a superartist, someone who knows what they are doing, someone who knows where the levers to my soul are.But I know that's extremely rare, that most art that I see as art is the result of someone just following their own urges, intuitive or accidental.

And there's every bit as much detective work involved. In these, you have three principles: Brett, who has some energy and an engaging notion of the character, a director and a screenwriter. As with all British mystery series, the game here is to have a different writer and director for each \"episode.\" Perhaps there were production reasons for this.Brett in this period was fat and dull from the drugs he was taking to control his condition, the very condition that made him and interesting Holmes. Internally exploding.The writer is Bowen. I have encountered him many times before in various detective screenplays. each time I have been repelled by his decisions. Mostly, they are decisions to cut the viewer out of the discovery game. This is pernicious business, these decisions.Film, even pedestrian TeeVee films, can be sharp, can help you butcher your demons, can start wildfires that cleanse. But only when the viewer is given power (and implicitly, respect). Often, this power comes free with the detective form, where we collaboratively weave narrative -- even what narrative means -- with the writer.Bowen refuses us this, and I hate him for it because he actively scours it out, removes it.So under normal circumstances, I'd be waving you off of this, especially since you likely will be seeing it on DVD and this is paired on a disk with a horrible episode, one of the worst experiences of all.But here's the magic of film. Even a sleeping actor and a woefully mistaken writer cannot kill a project if the director (and his team) have vision. And this young director does. He would go from this to TeeVee detective projects with good writers, then on to some very competent movies indeed, a best picture Oscar.So look at this and put yourself in the place of the director instead of the writer as you normally would do.

Yet the bar has gotten higher while certain narrative structures have become more acceptable. Nolan has earned a place as one of the best without a Spanish surname. It seems he starts with a notion of multiple parallelisms in narrative, then fleshes them out using some of the techniques common in or best literature, but always envisioned first cinematically. The five parallelisms here are: Warring magicians (mirrored by the warring real life magicians Tesla and Edison). The realities of life and pretended or performed life, with the common fold of the play we see and the performance(s) they make. Multiple existence of beings Different slices of time as the narrative is unrolled backwards and forwards in bits. The way the stories are recounted in two overlapping diaries, each a lure. Pay particular attention to this, and the fairly literate references, starting with Van Helsing and covering at least a few Shakespearean phrases.Its therefore 5 times more clever, engaging and rewarding than \"The Illusionist,\" itself a competent oneway fold.Spend some time with this.

But that makes it a bit more enjoyable if you come to this for the structure.The story device is simple: cold war spy versus spy, only to learn that the (then monopoly) phone company trumps all. But the narrative structure is apart from that. It employs James Coburn, then well known for what we could later call folded acting: where his persona as Coburn is folded into his reactions as the character.That character is an analyst, who at least for the purposes of the film, has the ability to see below the surface and understand causal dynamics. He first is exposed to the president, standing as the surrogate for one nation's psyche (in relation to others). We meet the surrogates for those others as they mostly bicker, except for two opposing spies (both under therapy from our doctor).It is a brilliant choice, having our own in-story viewer being an analyst. This differs from the usual formula of detective/reporter/lawyer. Among other possibilities, it allows for three sequences internal to the mind. One is a marijuana-laced lovemaking session in a field; another an LSD trip. The third is a similar psychedelic torture method applied by the phone company. Perhaps these worked decades ago, but I think not. You need something less flippant to help us reference internal reflection.But they did do a good enough job of conflating the internal mind of the first two into the technologically induced visions of the phone company's headquarters. And that matters to us. Because the phone company here has little to do with phones. It is instead the sort of pervasive spy that sees us the same way we as viewers are seeing the film. Indeed, the end of the film pulls back and we see an audience of 'people' from the phone company. These are not people in fact, but robots which in this fabulation of analysis removes them from the scope of the on-screen analyst, so that the noir formula is preserved: we the audience by our viewing directly enter the film and manipulate an unknowing, hapless character.Of course no one would ever consider this an art film with serious pretension.

They had consciously experimented with new forms based on underlying mechanics that today would be called \"new age\" and considered bogus. Their White Album was based on the kabbalistic structure of Alice in Wonderland, obfuscated by superficial stories and elaborated by hallucinogenic dynamics.One of the \"best friends\" during this period (friends of John and Ringo) was Nilssen. Out of that relationship came this.It preserves some of the mechanics: the relationship of small form song narrative to a larger assembly; the hallucinogenic imagery in word and film; the references to Pepperland and Alice, and even after a period of fighting for Ringo, he appears as the narrator. But as Harry was essentially a sweet drunk, it lacks the underlying ambition of The Beatles: to re- invent the common cosmology around less destructive geometry.Taymor would mine this for her visual exploration of the Beatles.And because Nilssen was a sex addict as well, much of the key imagery follows that, allowing for the transmission through the director/artist.

His own understanding of acting attracts some top flight talent, and here they are all as good as it gets. Even Micky Rourke is powerful! Nicholson starts a new career. Making a film is all about abstraction, and since it is a collective art, managing all the abstractions so that a single vision projects. The odder the vision, the more worthwhile, and the harder to corral. This man ruthlessly exploits everything that streams at us (including the music -- so apt). Del Toro is worth mentioning because he is currently in two other films of merit. But the cinematic flash there is all in support of either nothing (Snatch) or thin narrative support for a relatively vapid insight (Traffic). Here, not only is Del Toro amazingly real, but the whole film delivers powerful dramatic effect integrated with narrative, unlike the other two which are mostly dance.The IMDB comments posted before this are largely negative, and I speculate these are from younger folk -- further that the audience Pledge grabs in the gut will be among more experienced souls. The ending is great, the biggest emotional cliff since `Limbo.'But all that is just surface stuff -- a man pledging his soul and losing it when the bargain is usatisfiable. The really interesting thing is the ambiguity of the narrative. We know Penn is concerned with this issue -- really hot among thinking directors for the past couple years. Here he (and the original book) play Nabokov -- the pacing of the film resembles a madman's reminiscences. Yes, there are too many coincidences in the story. Yes it is framed by a mad drunk's mumblings. Yes, the camera deliberately takes non-contemporary human viewer perspectives. Yes, there are discontinuities. Yes, the `Lolita' references were many and obvious.What we have here folks is a multilayered weaving of reality and imagination. We saw Penn act at these two levels simultaneously in Woody's `Sweet and Lowdown.' Now he coaches buddy Jack (who has more to give and more to lose) into a more nuanced dual-level performance.

Every actor we see on the screen has another life. Every film somewhere contains a story about itself -- often it takes a film archeologist, but sometimes it is registered in a readable, even unavoidable way.All of the masters and a good many ordinaries play with this notion in one way or another. Some even take it on as a literal challenge: `Sunset Blvd.,' `Wayne's World,' `French Lieutenant's Woman,' `Apocalypse Now,' `Draughtsman's Contract,' `Bowfinger,' `8 1/2' quite a few. `The Player' has the advantage of excess which makes it seem unique. It is not, but because the method of making it is as much a part of the parody it is uniquely clever.Part of the parody is the one and only thing most people see. Dozens of actors play themselves amidst many other actors who play characters. Some of those characters are film types, some not. This shifting of worlds is a simple trick, but it works. Much more subtle (except at the beginning) is how Atlman uses the camera to sometimes be in the film's film world, then in his film world (the character's real world), then in our real world (the same as most of the actors). It starts with that first Wellesian shot which includes a comment on pretentiousness of such shots.The writer is watched by both use, but also by a writer who eventually gets his film produced. And of course at the end we discover that it is the film we have been watching. The player is the creator of the player at play. I love this stuff, but get offended when it is juvenile hands as is the case in say `8MM,' or even `Cut.' But Altman is different, he is smart and not at all afraid to take chances.

His intellect is always tuned to ideas about the visual, so we get a double measure: his images and his commentary on those same images. You should see this film if you think about communicating by image -- you won't find more beauty and recursive visual depth anywhere else.There are a few flaws in my mind, notable only because the film is so remarkable and because Greenaway shoots so high. A central dance here is the art of the writing (its appearance) and how that relates to the art the writing points to (its semantic meaning). So much elaboration of this works so well that I wonder why Greenaway went to such trouble to make the storyline so comprehensible. It is almost as if he is pandering to critics of his less accessible work. This greatly dilutes the impact for me, takes away from the point that the immediacy and fluidity and directness of the presentation by sense at least trumps the recoil by the mind. Perhaps is wholly substitutes. So why make so much sense? So that people will watch who wouldn't otherwise get it?I wish Greenaway played more with contrasting ritual with spontaneity, especially since the Japan/Hong Kong cultural contrast, the publishing versus modeling contrast (permanent versus faddish), and the promiscuous lovers versus the honored parents all set things up so well. In particular, the soluble temporary nature of the writing turned into permanent tattoos at the end. What of that? It looked decorative only.

Sure, it comes dangerously close to the banal. Sure, you can see a few seams and we all wish the budget for the final \"performance\" was bigger.

That second phase can make the experience worthwhile even when the film itself is ordinary or poorly done.But it works the other way as well, especially when a film is designed for discussion: the film delivered with so many opinions that themselves are ordinary or poorly done. This film comes so charged. Szpilman wasn't `Jewish enough' to be the center of an important holocaust film, goes the most ordinary and loudest of them. I suppose there are some things about the commingling of descriptive art and definitive life to be said there. But one likes to have more freedom in post-film thoughts and that whole topic is dominated by the sorts of reflexive responses manipulated by film.There's a second prepackaged topic concerning whether `Schindler' was better or `worse.' I don't consider Spielberg's film a holocaust film at all: he lives in a happy world, where justice and right (and lots of other happy values) always triumph. His observations are always external. His goal is always to tell a story, a stance that furthers the distance between his films and reality. Polanski's project has no story at all, merely a life of accidents. His camera is within the artist's personal space. His own mannerisms are Eastern European and depressed, congruent with what he shows. (Speilberg's Schindler really did have the silk unctuousness of the East, but as observed from California.) So I credit Polanski's vision as having more historical credibility than Speilberg's, knowing that despite the best efforts of us all to avoid having practical history made by the movie marketplace.(One exception, where Polanksi is offensively theatrical: when Szpliman runs from the destroyed hospital, he faces a street of desolation as far as one can see, `High Noon'-wise.)Much more interesting to my mind is the portrayal of an artist. Polanski has always been deeply self-referential in his work: always there is an examination of the artist within the art. And I make a minor hobby out of collecting film experiences that do this with music and mathematics because I have some personal experience to work with. For those who don't know: Polands pride is Chopin, who invented a relationship to the piano that not only defined modernity but reinvented everything about musical performance. (Film would follow this lead in 1941.) Chopin built pieces designed to be bent in performance, designed with empty rooms that a pianist could explore. Unlike, Bach for instance, where the magic of the performance was in attuning to Bach and his intent, the performer of Chopin really could bring his own soul to parity with God. Szpliman was a strong pianist, and therefore more than a national character, instead a reflection of the Polish heart.Here, we  watch this man compromise his own pride, eschew his religion, run away from every opportunity for dignity in order to keep his hands warm to play another day; and not just play, but play on the radio for Poles. So during this painful journey, we assume what we are meant to in films about tortured artists: that the pain we are watching will be transmuted by this man into great art that will lift us all. His own personal denigration - what is done to him and the denigrating choices he makes - are worth it overall.This is where the fatal pessimism of Polanski stops, because he doesn't let us know the musical truth. This is not Szpilmans playing of course, but not much unlike him. Szpilman was a `safe' player, one who never had the strength or desire to add much to Chopin. That's why he was on the radio: his `interpretations' were unchallenging and palatable. But he would never have been considered an artist of note at all if he had not survived the perfect brutality of the Germans, whose own music, though sentimental was constrained in ways that Chopin's never was. The payoff is supposed to be that after his trials, the artist is now - theoretically - capable of expressing the pain and yearning of the world. That we are meant to so think is clear from the end, where he plays with the glow of Dreyfuss from `Music of the Heart.'Ah, but not so. The sound we actually hear throughout is by Olejniczak, a similarly ordinary man. Szpilman did not in fact come through a better artist, but much worse: a meek pianist. `Shellshocked,' postwar contemporaries would say. Contrast this with Artur Rubinstein. Jewish Pole of the previous generation, and the first giant to explore Chopin's rubato. He had his own dark nights, but not because the world was inhospitable. Listen to his recordings (freely available) compared to Szpilmans (hard to get) or even Olejniczaks on the soundtrack. These are two different universes. One is merely pleasant, the other life-altering.Polanski has made some great films (including the under-appreciated `Ninth Gate'), and his thinking through of the intellectual reach of a project is extensive but he has ultimately let us down here. Implicit in much of modern Jewishness is the triumph of enrichment of the people through their tribulation.

It is based on the same general theme, providing opportunity for tearful, closeup apology and conversion to `normal' human.This film is marginally better that that disaster. The dialog at least has had the advantage of some polishing. The backdrop is populated with mere stereotypes. In the foreground, Stewart really does have grace -- good thing he was able to do solid work elsewhere because his hiccoughing happy drunk here is wholly unoriginal. Grant has one classical Grant moment: when he rings the candles near the end. This has some Mankiewicz touches: he knows how to overlay celebrity on the role, and that's all we have here folks -- the very type of Spy magazine celebrity that the film makes fun of. How ironic that Mankiewicz was utterly destroyed by what this system wrought (`Cleopatra').But this is Kate's picture, no doubt about that. She was in fact a prideful, arrogant prig who had suffered several boxoffice failures. Like her successes, these had little to do with the merits of the films or her acting. The public just didn't like her.So, she started a campaign to rejuvenate her image. The play was written for her specifically to satisfy this need: to show she could discover a heart. She worked it out on stage, then managed this comeback.The film has only two interesting features for me. The first is how Hepburn's face was made up and photographed. I understand this was a matter of much experimentation, and became the standard for all her black and white work (the color work would never be as good) as well as for many who followed. The lighting requirements (few front lights to accentuate the sunken cheeks) sometimes meant that the men standing next to her looked odd and malevolent-- something about which they complained.The other interesting thing concerns the subtext of the story. The frontmost matter is the tripe about a perfect woman in all regards except lacking a heart. (And the bit about that being the cause of her father's womanizing!)But the backmatter is about stooping to the reality of the fan magazines' celebrity machine. And that's what this is, pure and simple, with a nod that the writers behind the machine are often talent men with a higher calling. I'm sure the writers added that on their own.","id":"rw0022378"},{"movie":"Fantomen på operan","heading":"Building as Soul","date":"9 February 2005","content":"Orson Welles famously turned his version of Othello into a film about architecture  the sets become characters. When Greenaway did The Tempest, he did the same, more lushly: the building as mind housing books, one of which is written as we watch.Branaugh in his Hamlet attempted the same effect in Ophelia's madness scene, indeed even borrowing Welles' madhouse set from \"Lady from Shanghai,\" and the rolling camera from \"Marienbad\"  invented by Verny in that film and resurrected by Greenaway. Since then, the idea has become something of a trend in Hollywood, used even in one of the Harry Potters and the Depp Pirate movie.Schumacher is something of a thug in how he makes movies, but someone got to him on this score of making the building the star. In this case, it is apt to the story and pulled off with near-Lurhman intensity.The setup is this (at least in the book): we have a talented young girl who is cursed by twin demons: the devil of her art and the mundane attractions of \"normal\" sex. As with the projects noted, the building is her mind and soul with her lover controlling the roof and her devil the cellars. The first merger of self and building we see is her literally entering a mirror, Alice in Wonderland-wise. The production design was heavily influenced by Gilliam's \"Munchausen,\" another play about a play that is really a voyage through a soul  even copying a few of the statues. Gilliam's movie is in turn based on \"Les Enfants du paradis,\" which has a similar structure. This is the origin of most of the shots or the stage machinery.The building is not only featured in the story, but by the way the camera includes features. Many times the features are in the foreground (often out of focus) as well as the background, literally wrapping the action. All the bombastic rest of it, especially the music, would have been the empty excess most of the critics noted. But if you know the role of the building, just consider the rest of it the kind of gaudy decoration the French would have draped on a cursed soul of a building.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","id":"rw1017633"},{"movie":"The Phantom of Crestwood","heading":"Darts","date":"12 November 2004","content":"Spoilers herein.As a mystery, this is unengaging.

The movie starts with a reproduction of the announcement of the contest.Then we are run through a rather ordinary 'closed road to the estate' mystery, with tons of suspects and hidden passages. The novelty is that the head of a gang of thieves chooses to be the detective to get to the bottom lest he be blamed.The murder weapons are darts.

You no longer have to look at the movie, you can look at the machine behind it. That's something that's harder to do with stuff that actually engages, like Tarkovsky.In this case, we have all the standard pieces: radiation, a marine monster that happens to be the right geometry to house a man, foreign spies and so on. Every element is from the catalog. Every assembly is from a mass production rulebook. The music is also off the shelf: viola for suspense, harp for underwater movement and so on.But look and see the famous \"rule of twos.\" Sooner or later you'll have to make up your mind about the extent to which structure in art is an impediment or an aid. But before you get that far, you have to see the structures that are being used.Here we have two government investigators, one brainy the other brawny. We have two women, one young and alluring the other old and vengeful. We have two scientists, one honorable the other not.There are minor, very minor plot twists as we switch all of the doubles.

The first is the setting in Wales, or more precisely among the Welsh. Its an odd sort or layering for me since I think the 30's era English are as different, strange, quaint to me as the Welsh are shown here from the English. The language is emphasized in the setup, first half of the movie. They surely are depicted as alien. At the end, there's a clear balance between evil Welsh and noble ones that come to the rescue. The chief villain of course, the ringmaster, is English of course. That Imperial undercurrent!The second interesting thing is that the action, about 3/5s of the movie, takes place in an actual lighthouse, most at night. What an amazing challenge this must have been; there are no studio shots that I could discern. Its a small, curved structure with no opportunity to anchor the frame against a wall. There's lots of movement across different levels, as there must be, and some clever (from a staging point of view) movement from inside to outside.

Sometimes the folding is something only of interest to highbrow specialists, but usually it is a matter of fun.Some folding is a matter of introducing bizarre conventions, and once they enter in one film they promulgate throughout the system. And then through our imagination. So part of my study is looking for examples of folding and most especially the first appearance of specific types.This serial is usually considered an oddball secondrater compared to more famous (if not better) examples. But I am putting it on my list of films that everyone should see before they die. This brief description should indicate why, for those not excited about sitting through five hours of mediocre production.Gene Autry was already a famous radio star before making this. He was the first one to combine hee haw Appalachian folk music with the notion of a western cowboy to create the so-called \"singing cowboy.\" The juxtaposition is amazing if you know the history, and in fact the subsequent history of \"country and western\" music (now just \"country\") spins from this one man. But that's all before this.This is his first movie, so they preserved the radio show. Every day at 2:00, Gene (playing himself) must give a show or lose his ranch. The show is live from that \"radio ranch,\" where his ranch helpers play parts in the show. Okay: one simple fold, right? Now add: in producing the show instead of just doing sound effects and voices, the players actually do what they are portraying. Odd. (Another fold.)The purpose of the ranch is to provide a place for kids to do their \"ridin and ropin\" stuff, and indeed there are kids in attendance who form a secret society called the \"thunder riders\" after local legends (and experiences) seeing bands of riders inexplicably accompanied by thunder. This gang of kids is at the same time a feature of the story of the radio show, inhabitants of the ranch, and participants in the larger story we'll elaborate in a bit. A feature of the radio show is recruiting kids at home to join the riders in a sort of boy scout affiliation.Gene's ranch happens to sit on a radium deposit. Nuclear fission, even the idea, would be years away but radioactive stuff held a special place in the popular imagination. Needless to say, there is an evil professor and henchmen who want to eliminate Autry so they can get the radium. So far so good.But there is also a subterranean culture under the ranch as well, a huge city at 20,000 feet under, sustained by the radiation and rebellious robots. (Note: this is _before_ \"Flash Gordon.\") They have all sorts of advanced gadgets including something that gives their evil young queen effective remote vision, providing her with the creation of the movie. They, too, want Autry eliminated. The original \"thunder riders\" are the special forces of this city who emerge for whatever project is at hand.Thus, science fiction takes to horses and indeed every time some motion is needed as a break from the talking (and singing!) heads, there's a passel of panicky ridin, usually in groups of 20-30, which seems to be the most that can fit in a frame.The serial consists of all the ordinary captures and escapes (always by 2:00!) you might expect. In that sense, the thing is pretty ordinary, excepting that the substance of the radio show and the movie overlap and separate constantly. Its the novelty and complete oddity of the strange framework that makes the thing interesting and important. Film would never be the same after.The framework is clearly a matter of psychotropic hallucination, and indeed you can see the very same folded structure in the similarly drugged out \"Tell your Children\" written immediately after.If you decide to see it, don't use the DVD (which is technically horrible and is missing key elements), nor the silly movie they edited out of it.

The mix of tribal magic and industrial determinism was the whole point. The white man's burden, softened by a romanticized notion of natural purity.This has more to do with the yearning behind the creation of the Boy Scouts than by romance or adventure.But the movie turns it into a jungle version of Buck Rogers.\nIf you wish to get value out of this, watch it back to back with `CQ,` which is about the very same thing as the comic: about how film transmutes that romantic purity into something that has to be handled differently than in a comic because it overlaps with reality.

Bacall was the nice girl. It would be the last joint movie appearance for the two.But wait! Along comes this, a simplified remake of \"Petrified Forest\" for TeeVee. Bogart is back as the gangster, and Bacall the nice girl. This would be their actual last joint appearance. Henry Fonda was the good guy this time.It gives the impression of being a taped live performance, staged as the original play must have been. Bogart is tired, so tired. He may have already known he was dying. The rest of the players are stilted. Clearly, there was scant rehearsal and poor or no direction. So the actors all just run through their lines with the minimum of emotion and total lack of collaboration.Its a sad, sad disaster.

The first is that this Watson gets a huge amount of screen time to be funny in his bumbling way.The second is that to spice up the dreary thing, a monster is introduced. Its straight out of the Universal Studios pattern of Frankenstein, heavily padded body, lumbering walk, facial prosthetics, stunted brain. This character and his amoral brutality is only mentioned until the end where we finally see him, first as a shadow, then in shadow, then full on in terror. He's a marvelous invention but wholly out of place in a Holmes.And then there's the third notable thing. That end. Usually a Holmes story ends with Holmes not only successful, but successful on his own terms. He doesn't cheat, he uses his mind. The world is not emotional but logical, it is revealed. Always. But not here. He is confronted by two villains. He defeats one by lying. Holmes lying? Yes, friends, it is true. No guile, no intelligence, no supergenius, just a simple, uncreative lie. And the other villain, the one that is a real challenge?Remember that Indiana Jones movie where Indy is paired against a giant with a deadly sword. The joke is Indy just shoots him. The joke is because we expect something true to character, something dynamic and brutal and honorably victorious. That joke was the best part of the movie because it stood outside the genre. It literally did: that day Ford was too tired and sick to do the fight that was arranged. So he became an actor commenting on the character. It worked there.Here, it is just a blot.

Or they do it once, and then just live in the world they've created. Others are amazingly clever at some point, and equally banal at others. Polanski comes to mind.When this was new, it was groundbreaking, truly an achievement. It worked.Lumet's approach is actor-centric, not something I particularly value. But it is perfect for an exploration of a man: world growing from an individual. Lumet also likes to use space, but he doesn't know the containment properties of space, only the dividers, so we have the shop will all sorts of walls and fences. The lover's apartment as well.What was new was this was the first movie  mainstream US movie  to use nudity. Its underwhelming today thank heaven, but rather shocking in its day, especially because the woman is black, and a seller of sex.In the project, it triggers the most extended flashback sequence, one that involved our hero's deepest disaster. Overlapping flashbacks had been used, most famously in \"Manchurian Candidate,\" which resembles this in some ways. But it hadn't been so fragmented, so apparently integrated into the fabric of the man. We see a desperate whore; he sees his humiliated wife. We see street thugs beating up a drunk; he sees the holocaust.This cinematic device is now so common as to not be remarkable. Sex (in the form of exposed breasts) and Nazis both had more cinematic power then than now.Is it greater art if we digest it, even if the work itself becomes ordinary in the process?

You would think that after generating a billion dollars in the two years around this film, he would want to spend some of that goodwill on responsible citizenship in his adopted country. Instead, what we get is 'Braveheart' presented as history. It was fine in Braveheart to just make things up -- that was a mythical time and a relatively magical place. Creating a saintly giant is just good storytelling. But recent history is something else. History that changes the basic equations that defined the nation is something else.

(So much of the New Testament was fabricated anyway.) This is instead a simple matter of unwisely trusting the actor's viewpoint.There are two worlds in the community of film-making. One world is the world of the composer, someone who worries about the multidimensional effect of the thing. In this world, before you start, you engineer the narrative stance, the physics of the world involved and the identity of the camera. You confabulate dozens of things before finding the niche that the actor fills. If you are lucky you'll find actors that are (1) intelligent enough to understand what you are doing and talented enough to collaborate (2) compliant enough to do what the filmmaker wants without understanding (or usually caring) or (3) someone who has a pre-existing persona that fits the niche.Nearly all actors are of type 2 and 3, which means that they are the last people who really know what a movie is all about. Australia has institutionally made a commitment to producing actors of type 1. So we have the very, very best of our film actresses through that school, and some fine male actors as well.But not Mel, alas. He's just as thick as an Alabama pancake. Even though he learned the craft of directing from Peter Weir, he's not picked up Weir's balanced approach. Weir works from both ends: from the composition as a whole (see the masterful \"Hanging Rock\" for an example of this) as well as from the \"Scorcese\" end where all the physics of the world come from the characters.When Gibson did \"Braveheart\" he was able to hide this weakness in the massive battle scenes which for a movie of that type IS the structure in a way. But not here. What we have is no composition outside the dynamics of the people, even though scripture and subsequently layered legends provide plenty.This is the worst of film: a film made by an actor based on solely an actor's perspective... based on a story that discards everything in the rich rich world (even if you limit it to the Bible) except the individual, one individual.

She wasn't great at evoking the tone of a place, nor creating fully dimensional characters. She wasn't a master of the language. Today, we seem to prefer florid language, novel insertions into situations, (cats, priests, exotic locals and professions) and `psychological' weight.But where she excelled was at understanding the elements of the mystery and devising plots that were not just clever but clever in ways that recognize the fact that it is a mystery story. Often the characters include a writer (or someone in showbusiness). And the twist would be an artifact of the telling of the story rather than the action within the story. She might have the narrator be the murderer, or have the murder victim be misidentified by the reader (and incidentally the people involved). Reading her work, at least in the middle years, is a lesson in understanding the form and bending the content to suit. It is a postmodern idea not appreciated in our postmodern times. That is especially so when films are made of her stories. The BBC usually does a `faces and places' treatment, where characters and settings are supposed to amuse us until the end when we are surprised. The ending isn't the resolution of a puzzle, a tussle between writer and reader, but rather an expected but undeserved gift.This particular production is less offensive than the BBC ones, especially the Poirot ones. It bears little resemblance to anything she wrote. But the spirit is dimly there: we have a confusing barrage of individuals and situations. The clues aren't presented fairly enough, but in a story this abbreviated they cannot be. I think there is a lesson here. This script is close in tone to the overwhelming possibilities and suspended clearances of the books. But it is a dreadful film because we expect to know where we are and where we are going.

More, it would be a waste of your life, a sin, to watch it except for one person, Carol Haney.Her story is that she was a dancer, a good one. A very good one who became Gene Kelly's assistant, and who taught several of his partners to dance. When we watch those old dance movies and marvel at these woman, what we see is an imperfect copy of Carol.She was able to go to Broadway as a performer and was a success, which led her to a secondary role in this movie. After beginning, a role was rewritten to accommodate her.During the filming of this, she suffered bodily damage and additionally was diagnosed as diabetic. She died shortly afterward, her body used up. So this  three musical numbers  is all we have. Two are absolutely amazing, the result of her collaboration with choreographer Bob Fosse. These would make his career.So, I am recommending you watch this piece of trash, this horrible thing, for those two numbers so you can be exposed to someone special. She deserves it and you do too.But there's a bittersweet pleasure in watching, a sort of noir cloak we put on as the cost of admission. Because this woman is making something for herself and us that is destroying her.Why? Why do we value damage? Billie, Judy, Janis as singers, valued because they risked everything. Not every time, but when they do and they touch outside their safe boundaries, they touch outside ours as well in some way. But dance is ever so much more explosive because each time with someone like this, each time the body risks damage that can be permanent  a life of pain for one instant of shared performance.Look at this and see.

Or even \"Black Narcissus.\"I don't know this director, but he had me at the first sequence, one of the most effective beginnings I know. A sparse, angry man and his wife have just been dropped off in the middle of the wild in China. They arrange themselves in a very careful triad with us, what each of us is staring at is significant, and the motions of each of us as we relax out of the pose tells us all we need to know to enter that world.

When he wanted a new Perry Mason story, just turn the sliderule and fill out the combination it showed. These were immensely popular, easily generated and satisfying to many readers. Disney himself was intrigued by what Gardner called his \"fiction factory,\" and consulted with the man in setting up his non-animation division, Buena Vista.From that tradition comes this. It cannot be called a mess. It is competently enough produced. It has some comedy (kids like diaper jokes), some action, and the essential support-of-kids message that these things need. The weakest part is Diesel, who may have the intensity for Riddick but not for a drill sergeant. Even the kids in the audience snickered when he tried to act tough at the beginning.So, on and on, you have set pieces, distributed through the children, all circling around that on moral that sells: family.If you want to know if there is anything at all worth watching in this, or exposing your kids to, yes, there is.

Even when you deeply lose yourself in the experience, the cognitive machinery you use is different than in daily life — more toward directed dreamstate. Added to that is the knowledge of actors. When I see some actors, they carry prior roles or real world personalities into the narrative; that perturbs the experience. In this case, it adds deeply.The overall shape of this is promising. It uses three ideas.* the detective story was invented as a response to Darwinism and the fears of Victorian society; because there was the threat of universal explanation through \"science,\" free will vanished. So at the same time that Conan Doyle was created a superlogical observer, many others (and indeed including himself) were flocking to supernatural believes. (We still see this today.) So it makes great sense to have our detective be the greatest logician in the land. He is indeed an emeritus at Oxford, struggling with the limits of logic. Logic is presented here in the intelligent sense of mathematical logic and though they get Wittgenstein wrong, the conceptual placement is right.* one thread of this is the supposed dramatic conflict between passions of the mind and the flesh. This is a pretty common notion with mathematicians in films, something akin to evil mania underlying brilliant scientists. The reason we tolerate it is because it helps to move passion of vision into a space that can be conveyed by film. For many mathematicians, insight can as often be orgasmic as ecstatic, so at least the intent works.* detective stories these days have to have clever twists and more than one reveal and false ending. This has some particularly clever twists, in some measure related to the two threads above.All in all, though the execution isn't glorious, the elements add by merely existing. But then for me it was terrific because of what I bring to it. I know many of the places where this was filmed, and I know characters somewhat like everyone depicted. But it is the actors that expanded this way beyond its bounds.Let's start with the love interest, a woman who fell in love with two mathematicians and regrets it. This is something of an anchor for me because this is played by the woman who was \"her\" in \"Talk to Her.\" She had allure and mystery in that film that was so overwhelming she carried it to here, though the photography is not friendly to her. The faces are lit will stark lighting on one side as if we are supposed to get the idea of hidden identity.There is an older woman, a mathematical curmudgeon. She is played by a 71 year old actress, with a distinctive face and manor. She was the anchor of a famous film \"Peeping Tom\" where she was the innocent redhead target. (All the women in that Powell film were, including his lover.) This self-referential film was so controversial that the director was blackballed. You can never see this woman, still lovely, without recalling that role.Oh gosh, and thrown in we have Frodo Baggins and Princess Irulan Corrino! Wow, talk about a mix!

All actors like to play characters that cannot be whole characters, either because they are damaged or they are actors. Every actor eventually gets around to it.It is already the case that actors refer to prior portrayals rather to reality. Juliette gets extra points in my book for passionate commitment.

Cheap effects, poor production skills by modern standards and cheap theatrics are all ignored when there is even the dullest of hooks. I grab and am willingly pulled through. Hey, I even liked \"Miss Congeniality.\" I even cried at the disgustingly manipulative \"Little Miss Sunshine.\"So I could have cruised through this, hanging on the one device it has: our surrogate viewer in Mary. It could have worked too, if Scarlett was a deeper actress and was able to convey that all the lushness we see is because her eye is in a decorated mind. It could have worked if it wasn't such a closed world.The \"closed world\" deal means this: everything we see is \"explained\" or tightly bound up in the story? Henry is king? Well then his kingliness is bound up exclusively in dressing, having fun and worrying about babies. There's no tie to anything outside what is carefully strung together with visible ribbons. No character, no urge, no happening crosses the shell that contains what we see. This is underscored by the way the cinematographer handles the visuals. Yes, he gives us more lushness in framing and positions than usual. But in keeping with the costumes, these are all from a well known vocabulary, just more elaborate. And the physical framing is closed world. Its stagy. There's nothing that bleeds off the frame to imply that there is anything at all in the universe but what you see.This is why people call this soap opera-ish. It isn't because of the emotional dynamics themselves, which are strong enough to matter in a worthwhile container. Its this notion from the TeeVee that there are only a few people in the world and the story is just a matter of who sleeps with who.But there's a larger opportunity missed here. There really are only two choices you have when combining great societal movements with personal emotions in this way. Either you can posit a world of great souls who somehow pull the world into a future, shaping by the power of being they have. Then we study that power.Or you go the way that things seem to the audience: things happen that are uncontrollable triggering incidental forces on the people who are in the way: political leaders and interesting people notwithstanding. Its something friendly to the noir tradition that we know a lot about now. They did neither here, and since they didn't give us a known cosmos, that stifling of the closed world is accentuated.Too bad. This was an interesting time, leading up to and preparing the way for the literary enlightenment that still glows, now in film. The times literally resulted in a storied way from what emerged from then through Shakespeare and Harriot, through settling the new world with idealists rather than simple catholic thugs.... on through to the creation of the rich vehicles for thought we have now: like the stuff a available to grab for this film and this comment. Henry was a responsible monarch, less driven by personal desire to see a spawn rule, but more concerned about shaping the future. That meant severing ties with the Catholics, a tie denoted by his marriage. She had to go for reasons outside her womb. The entanglements of religion, wealth, power had to be reshaped. We know he was most thoughtful in this, that he recognized a dying feudal system and the rise of urbanism. We know that his daughter  far less intelligent  followed through with his plan and got all the credit.None of this open world stuff is visible here.

I laugh and more importantly I cry when I'm supposed to. I am a sucker. In fact, I have laughed and cried with Roos' other projects, swept along as per design.But this movie is different, and it pushed past the ordinary barriers I establish for movie life, barriers I didn't even know were there.Here's the setup: we have a movie, with love and events and discovery just like any other movie. There actually are characters and some pithy engagement among them and with us. But thats only the excuse for the filmmaker to have a completely separate dialog with us. The movie is the excuse for that dialog, though sometimes the higher level of engagement between us and Roos will borrow from the story.He is, in fact, having a sort of sex with us at the same time he tells us its the opposite, a different sort of attraction and seduction.Roos' surrogate is Ricci in voice-over narration. It is the very best she has been, except for that bowling alley scene in \"Buffalo.\" Since she isn't a great acting talent, what this means is that the role is a perfect fit for her sort of sexual detachment.The narration starts out commenting on the movie, telling us what kind of movie this is not, and how we cannot expect her to behave as if she were in a movie. She leaves home and steals a gun. While doing so, she tells us to pay attention, that the gun will prove significant. Then, she deliciously shifts back into character and says that's foreshadowing and we studied that in school.This is pretty shocking stuff, this shift out of the movie, using moviedom's most intimate trick, the internal noir narrative that starts such films. We immediately have a bond with this girl, but in her role outside the movie. As the movie rolls on, she bonds intimately with many characters, and each is an opportunity for us to readjust the relationship we have with her outside. It is sex, no it is the opposite of sex, at least movie sex. But it is attraction as strong. And when it goes wrong, as it must, it is devastating.

In that world, even popular actors move props and the simplest gopher criticizes the players until they get it right. In that world, films are an outgrowth of a stylized stage tradition that emphasizes physical acting. In this tradition, Li is probably the chief dancer, perhaps the best there is. In this world, they use him for his physical grace and his way of expressing himself with his body.But he has an evil twin in a parallel universe called Hollywood. In this universe, films are something wholly different, a much gaudier spectacle in which fireworks and noise are the attraction. Actors are primarily marketing elements and are expected to act through dialog. In fact most actors in this world never learn to use their bodies at all. There is some physical motion, but that is arranged by digital magic and stunt standins.This film is a battle between the honest and evil Lis for the one body. What's interesting is watching the good Li try to bring something from the other world. He does try some esoteric, subtle shading in the fighting styles, stances and motions of the two versions of himself. The good Li uses motions from the Hong Kong era that are genuine. The evil Li uses a parody of moves that aren't real at all but copies of what western kids think martial arts looks like. What he does is a big joke, and something to admire and respect, for him to poke fun at his western audience, at least for those of us who pay attention.In Hollywood films, there has to be all this foolery with guns. See `Once Upon a Time in China' to get a feel for the background battle between shooting/blowing-up movies and martial arts films.

Carpenter's stuff, Barker's stuff always find an audience. And this movie is about as good as they are, which is to say a 2 on a scale of ten.What makes this film truly remarkable is that it was made not as a mere opportunity to skim money from the trailer park crowd. Instead, this film is deeply self-referential: The filmmakers themselves are engaged in a battle with the devil and the film is a salvo in that war, the same war depicted in the film.Part of the shock is that virtually no film today takes itself seriously in every respect, and on that basis alone this film demands that we apply a more rigorous scale. Just on that, this film needs to be slapped hard -- being just ordinarily bad is amplified when you claim the work comes from God.But add to that the difficulty of the `truth' that the film relies on. It relies on a notion of fate, and on a use of the Bible which is radically unbiblical, instead subconsiously invented to attract and bind committed members. This specific notion of apocalypse has predicted the end of times within a generation for the last 120 generations!And on top of that, some numeric monkey business with the text of scripture is employed, which is fine enough for fiction. But the film and the books behind it tie this to Kabbalah. I know something about Kabbalah and can report this is absolutely incorrect. Kabbalah is supposed to be the true word of God, a mystical oral tradition because what was  given to Moses could only be imperfectly and ambiguously translated into the written work. In other words, the secrets of Kabbalah are unbiblical by definition.If you wish to see an intelligent film based on study of Kabbalah, directed by a first class director, with more competent acting, check out `The Ninth Gate.' It takes some work in viewing. I live down the road from Pat Robertson's Christian film university/broadcasting center/law school.

A stormy night. A collection of stranded travelers. A very spooky house, containing a family of deranged people and their even stranger butler.In turn, each character performs the most extreme behavior we can expect from their roles. It is hard to know at this distance in time how much humor Whale intended with this. Everything that could be over the line of serious presentation is.

Sex in four incarnations.An interesting decision is that there is no hierarchy, no agent more prominent or in control than any other. The wheel spins and who is central at that moment is left behind the next. Even the character of the house is not exploited as many would. The set was actually shown off to better effect, I think, in a following film: Secret of the Blue Room. There the place had agency. Here it is just an accident of place.There is considerable art here in suppressing the notion of a master agent. This is a mystery like many of the period, but with no crime, detective or solution.

Sesame Street cannot possibly be as educational as advertised, but great effort is obviously spent convincing parents that it is.Well, here we have something that is educational in a narrow sense, but very well engineered for kids. Let's set aside the specification of the character set, the determination of the animation style, the jokes, the paceWhat impressed me is how the synthetic world is placed. Suppose that a goal of the project is to introduce kids to the marvels of living creatures and systems of living creatures. Choosing the oceans is almost a no-brainer because of the diversity and strangeness of the creatures, plus the fact that kids normally don't encounter sea creatures.Much harder is deciding how to span our world with theirs. Look at what has been done here. The representative of our world is a band of anthropomorhized animals. We explore with them and also get educated by them, but the emphasis is on exploration and care of the explored. The octonauts are headed by a sea creature, an octopus that oddly breathes air not water and seems the most human of the band. The group also — and essentially, I believe — includes 'vegimals' a further hybrid that blends animals and plants. We (the humans in the audience) are blended, folded into our representatives, and they are folded into what they observe.Now look at the other side of the divide: the sea creatures are themselves anthropomorphized, but to a subtle lesser extent.

It doesn't have to even be a very competent story if the story is so rich that you can skip from point to point and fill in the gaps yourself.This is ostensibly the story of the making of the film, \"Oceans 11.\" That story is simple: Sinatra was eager to make the most money he could, and gain the highest fame available for the least work. So, with his buddies he devised a scheme to make a movie about robbing casinos while working for one. We hear how difficult he was.But the story ranges far and wide.It covers the rise of Las Vegas as the gambling and prostitution capital of the country and the role Sinatra played. This includes the story of bringing organized crime to a new level of power and influence in the country. And this story leads to the story of how organized crime arranged to get JFK elected, and how subsequently Lawford provided Mob-supplied girls to the president and his brother, until RFK started the first real campaign against organized crime. And then an enraged Sinatra was out of the White House.It also touches on the role Lawford played in getting Marilyn Monroe into the president's bed, but only slightly. And it does mention that he was the last to see her, but refrains from reporting various theories about her death.We do see how offensively misogynistic and selfish, and thuggish he was. It isn't pointed out; in fact, the voice overs (which include Walter Cronkite) are uniformly celebratory. But its grindingly obvious that these people are not worthy of our attention.There is a side story though, that is pretty heartbreaking. Sammy Davis Jr really was a talented guy, and never afraid of working for the hearts of an audience. But he fell in love with a white woman. Its hard to fathom that even someone at his level was not allowed to eat, sleep or play in the very places where he entertained.

That's the basic nature of TeeVee news: the pictures don't tell you anything and because of the limited vision actually distort.But this material was potentially different. Nazism was all about images and their manipulation in popular media, especially film. So I was expecting something special: a powerful set of images about a powerful set of images, and perhaps why/how they `turned evil.' Possibly no subject offers such a rich opportunity to break out of the TeeVee `voice with pictures' model.But I was disappointed. The voice gives good enough information if you know nothing about the subject, though it is repetitive in the three disks and clearly cribbed wholesale from the few studies on the subject. But even this is substantially less information than you can read in about the same time. For instance, they leave out all the `hollow earth' stuff and most of the Fire and Ice science. They left out the similar racial jingoistic, Kabbalistic ideas that grew up in the Jewish community in parallel, ideas which lent some superficial legitimacy to what the Austrians were inventing.But the truly odd thing was how little the images had to do with what was being said.

It can change fate, perturb the laws of the universe, transmute.What makes this an unsatisfying movie is that it appears about 2/3s of the way through that this is not the case. The story seems to imply  and uncareful viewers will believe  that there is an ordinary explanation, that the way things are isn't because a transmutation has occurred, but that a set of causes in the past is discovered. They were there all along, before encountering the book; the book has no agency in the world. At the end, that uncareful viewer will be unhappy. Perhaps even, this is what the director and actors believed the story to be.But pay attention to the way it is written, and by that I mean both the story and the film.Its entirely possible to see this movie as the story of the book changing this man's reality. And not in the simple way that he believes he is in the book, but in the magical way that his being  and entire past  is changed by it. There's a sort of superpowerful story that can do this.Yes, it will have some universal structure, some family of hinges, that it leverages because it has to expose the bones of the world in order to reshape them. Here, its a number hinge. I suppose that's a good choice, given what the viewing public thinks about the structure of the world: I saw this together with \"The Last Mimsy\" which used visual faceted vision in the same way. And \"Pi,\" \"Proof\" and that mathematical excrescence \"Beautiful Mind.\" All of these like numeric structure or pattern as illuminative of a worldly structure that we can grab.Tellingly, they always accompany this with massive writing, often on walls. Its the writing that makes the handles, you see.Here, its done with no sensitivity to delivered narrative, that connection to us. Blame the filmmaker. Its not as effective as \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\" or \"Singing Detective,\" but as a structure, its pretty darn intelligent.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw1718987"},{"movie":"Dagboken - Jag sökte dig och fann mitt hjärta","heading":"Folded Prayers","date":"26 June 2004","content":"Spoilers herein.There's a lovely Shinto tradition of folding prayers and leaving them on trees. The more clever, careful and perfect the fold, the more whole the message will be.I am in the midst of writing a book about `folding' in film. Folding in this context refers to layers of some kind that carry double meaning. The simplest and easiest to describe is the kind of folding in this little movie.A movie is a message sent to us and sugared enough in some way that we will receive it. One of the most effective flavorings is the `love story' which though invented by books is now exclusively owned by cinema. The message we send to ourselves and our loved ones about what love IS is a message that comes from films, each of which is a lower order of message.Sparks understands this, so he devises stories about messages. With `Message in a Bottle,' he did it simply with one layer. Here, he employs three, which added to the two above makes five folds in this slick film, five origami birds approaching our window.Sparks' three messages are:the one from Noah to Allie every daythe notebook of the title that Allie wrote, effectively to herself to use her love to bring herself back to her lovethe letters that Noah wrote, one per day for a year.Now whether you find the gauzy valentine haze too sweet, or the notion of the world (not just the world of love) too smooth and safe, you have to admire how this film was conceived. These sorts of things don't happen by accident, they are engineered by people who study the deep cognitive mechanics of this business. Oddly, the plot suggests that happy unengineered accidents are what are more real.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.","id":"rw0893212"},{"movie":"The Ninth Gate","heading":"Its all about the images!","date":"31 March 2000","content":"This is not a thriller, and thats a good thing. Instead, this is an intellectual film about the relationship between the viewer and the filmmaker. Anyone who knows Polanski, and for that matter many of our best filmmakers, knows he wonders about what it means to make a real movie, one that works as art. Which is to say it does more than amaze and entertain.This movie is to Polanski as The Name of the Rose was to Umberto Eco. That was a book about what books arent. This is a movie about what movies arent.Caution, spoilers ahead!The story is frail -- thats the point, in fact a little too obvious for my taste. The book in question has been poured over for over 300 years, with everyone focused on the text. And that text is completely irrelevant, disposable, just as the story of the film is. The whole point of the film is in its images, the story is deliberately degraded to make the point. (The images are great: Polanksi working in partnership with LCR?)Its all about abstraction. How could viewers not catch the layers of the inferno/hosts of angels references?--at the bottom level, you have the Frenchman who owns the book but isn't interested except for the beauty of the binding--then you have the Baroness who has spent her life writing about the devil and never even considering the pictures, even though she had the best clue--she SAW him.--at a higher level, you have Liana Tefler, who knows theres some power in the artifact but is still focused on the text (and incidentally sex)--higher still you have Balkan who knows the text is worthless, and the pictures the real value but thinks the magic is in the pictures--then you have the two brothers who have the power to tinker with the power of the pictures--finally Corso who we see moving from the bottom of the list to this layer where he knows the power is not in the pictures themselves, but in the quest. (At the beginning, the value of the book to him is neither in its text, nor pictures, but in its binding and rarity.)--then we have the girl who IS the pictures--and we have the viewer.This is a cross, four people stacked, the two brothers and then three more people stacked -- A layering actually used in early 17th century tracts on the nature of abstraction, which in retrospect are called occult. In fact it is the same layering of semiotics outlined by Eco, and much earlier used in the apprentice novels of Goethe (including Faust, which this story quotes).\nThats nine players, eight levels of consciousness created by the filmmaker, each layer tossing aside something. Who is the ninth player, the final abstractionist? You.","id":"rw0532624"}]
